The terms below are used throughout the Facilitation Best Practices
documentation, and often with definitions specific to their context
within the documentation. To establish consistent interpretations of
these terms across various sections and chapters, we define the terms as
follows.


Facilitator
: an individual working directly with researchers and/or other scholars
with a personalized approach to enhance their ACI capabilities for
transformative impacts to scholarship. (See also, *[Introduction > What is
Facilitation?](../introduction/#whatis)*). Throughout the Facilitation Best Practices
documentation, we use the capitalized form of the noun in order to
distinguish our definition of Facilitator from more generic definitions
of facilitator.

facilitation
: the practice of enhancing a researcher’s own capabilities in using ACI
for transformative impacts to scholarship products. (See also,
*[Introduction > What is Facilitation?](../introduction/#whatis)*.)

ACI-REF
: *(Advanced Cyberinfrastructure - Research and Education Facilitators)*
: (1) a Facilitator directly affiliated with the NSF-sponsored project of the
same name, or 
: (2) the NSF-sponsored collaboration of multiple
institutions invested in the professional development of Facilitators in
support of cyberinfrastructure scholarship. Throughout the Facilitation
Best Practices, we strive to clarify which entity is referred to by
using more specific language, such as “ACI-REF project”, “ACI-REF
institutions”, or “an ACI-REF”.

ACI
: (advanced cyberinfrastructure) 
: information technology (IT) hardware,
software, and human resources to be leveraged together as infrastructure
with formal support. The use of these elements is more specialized or
“advanced” as compared to information technology for generalizable
activities such as email, document creation/sharing, desktop/laptop
provisioning and support, etc. See also “ACI resource”. “ACI” may be
used as a noun, but is more often used as a descriptor for more specific
nouns, as in “ACI resource”, “ACI staff”, “ACI provider”, etc., as
described below

	ACI resource or service
	: a specific human (Facilitator, systems administrator, etc.), software
	(user applications, middleware, configuration), or hardware element in
	support of ACI, or to groupings of these elements in support of a
	specific ACI capability. Such resources and/or services will typically
	be available to users that are external to the service provider. For
	example, a research computing service may be thought of as a collective
	ACI resource for research computing, including the hardware,
	configuration, scheduling middleware, attached data storage, available
	applications, administration, and human support.	

	ACI resource types or categories
	: various natural or informal groupings of ACI resources, as they pertain
	to specific types of cyberinfrastructure needs.  For example, the
	following might each be thought of as ACI resource categories: research
	computing services, networking and data transfer infrastructure, data
	storage/sharing services (not directly associated with research
	computation). Importantly, these and other types of ACI resources need
	not be mutually exclusive.

	ACI system
	: a specific ACI resource consisting only of hardware and software
	deliberately configured to meet specified user needs; for example, a
	research computing cluster, a building network or campus network
	backbone, a specific file system or archival data store, or a pool of
	virtual servers

	ACI organization or provider
	: the entity responsible for providing a specific set of ACI resources or
	services, which may pertain to a specific type or category (such as
	“research computing”, see below) or to multiple categories of support
	within the same entity

	ACI staff or personnel
	: the team of human support for a given ACI system, resource, or provider,
	whose affiliation will be made clear with additional context

	research computing
	: an ACI resource or group of coordinated resources available to meet the
	computational needs of researchers, usually in a “large-scale” approach
	to take advantage of additional CPU and memory capacities. Physical
	resources within research computing services often include server-based
	clusters and filesystems that are managed by a centralized service
	provider and team of staff. Because the ACI-REF program includes
	Facilitators who are most-closely associated with centralized research
	computing service providers, many of the examples in the Facilitation
	Best Practices documentation are explained within the context of common
	approaches for supporting research computing on campuses.


outreach
: activities that promote awareness of ACI resources, service providers,
and/or systems to encourage interest in pursuing them. (See *Outreach* for
more details and examples.)

engagement
: meetings with one to several researchers to discuss ACI needs, recommend
appropriate next steps in an ACI Plan, provide personalized orientation
to any ACI resources, follow up and/or establish relevant opportunities
for assistance and learning (See *[Engagement with 
Researchers](../activities/03-engagement)* for more
details and examples.)

ACI plan
: a set of recommendations from a Facilitator to establish the overall
approach for leveraging relevant ACI resources, as well as the next
immediate steps and contributions from ACI staff, following an
engagement with a researcher(s). (See *[Education and Training of
Researchers](../activities/06-education)* for more details and examples.)

on-boarding
: the processes of orientation and initial ramp-up in abilities for either
(1) researchers new to using an ACI resource or service, or (2) newly
hired Facilitators. (See *Getting Established* for more details and
examples of the second case.)

assistance
: support for users of ACI resources, provided via a variety of
communication pathways (email, office hours, meetings, etc.) by
Facilitators, though sometimes also by other ACI staff. (See *[Assisting
Researchers in the Use of ACI Resources](../activities/05-assistance)* for more 
details and examples.)

education
: learning materials or events with the goal of providing information on
concepts and capabilities regarding a particular topic, typically
without the use of hands-on examples. (See *[Education and Training of
Researchers](../activities/06-education)* for more details and examples.)

training
: learning materials or events with the goal of teaching specific skills
and practices, typically with workable, hands-on examples. (See
*[Education and Training of Researchers](../activities/06-education)* for more 
details and examples.)
