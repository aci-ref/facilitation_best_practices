# Introduction

One of the main duties of a Facilitator is meeting with researchers in
order to better understand their ACI needs and to help them select the
appropriate resources and approaches. To that end, engagements, important for
accelerating the adoption of ACI resources in support of research
endeavors, play a crucial role in an ACI plan's development and in
contributing to the plan's success. Activities defined as engagement may include:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>Development of ACI Plans describing the overall strategies by which a
	researcher will proceed</li>
	<li>Implementing the use of one or more ACI resources for a project</li>
	<li>Attending initial and on-going meetings to discuss a researcher's
projects, goals, and roadmap</li>
	<li>Collaborating with a researcher on a portion of their project related
to ACI, to enable their near-term use of a resource</li>
	<li>Transferring knowledge that leads to a researcher’s effective
utilization of resources</li>
	<li>Developing long-term plans as part of a larger ACI plan</li>
	<li>Consulting with a researcher on aspects of a project for which the
	Facilitator has domain expertise</li>
    </ul>
</div>

As a rule, tasks done on behalf of a researcher without the researcher's involvement are not considered engagements. 

Engagements can be both formal and informal. For example, an informal
engagement might arise from a meeting to help resolve a straightforward
issue (an example documented in *[Assisting Researchers](../05-assistance)*). This can
turn into an engagement when the Facilitator realizes that a) she/he
needs to know more about the individual or their research; b) the
researcher was directed towards ACI resources without proper planning;
or c) the plan, formal or not, is insufficient to the point that you
must intervene. A formal engagement is typically a deliberately
scheduled initial or ongoing meeting between the Facilitator and the
researcher to capture ACI needs and develop an action plan for meeting
those needs.

<img class="non-captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cesar_cr2.jpg" alt="Cesar introducing a new faculty member to HPC."/>
Just as engagements can be formal and informal, so can ACI Plans. In
cases where the research needs are straightforward and the researcher
has a sufficient background in the use of ACI resources, the plan may be
as simple as providing basic information on accessing the resources and
on usage policies. In other cases, the researcher may have limited or
even no experience with the use of ACI resources and may be looking for
guidance on how to begin or determining what can and cannot be done. In
either case, having an initial engagement with a new user of ACI
resources is a good idea, as it serves as an introduction of the
Facilitator and the role of facilitation to the researcher.

The remaining sections will address best practices for successful
engagements. "[Overview of an Engagement Meeting](#overview)" describes how to
prepare for a meeting, what to consider during the meeting, and how to
conclude a meeting. "[Record Keeping of User Interactions](#records)" 
focuses on the procedures,
policies, and tools needed to effectively manage engagements, and
includes guidelines on documenting user interactions and measuring the
engagement process.

# Overview of an Engagement Meeting

A Facilitator is charged with broadening the usage of ACI resources as
well as assisting researchers in achieving better and quicker research
outcomes through the use of ACI. To this end, engagements are a vehicle
for making formal contact with the researcher as well as gathering
knowledge about their research and computing needs. As an engagement
requires direct interaction with a researcher, a face-to-face
meeting is recommended at least for the initial meeting. 

The impetus of initial engagements vary between institutions, and even
between departments within an institution, but commonly they arise from:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
    	<li>requests for access to ACI resources</li>
	<li>training workshop follow-ups</li>
	<li>new faculty on-boarding sessions</li>
	<li>assistance for an issue related to use of a ACI resource</li>
	<li>referrals from other IT personnel, departments, or other researchers</li>
    </ul>
</div>

The product of this meeting should be an course of action — an ACI plan
— that outlines how the ACI team can be of assistance, in addition to
providing a roadmap for future engagements and projects involving the
researcher.

For follow-on engagements the Facilitator may continue to meet in person
or conduct subsequent meetings via web conferencing or by telephone.
She/he will most likely be simultaneously corresponding via email and, 
depending on what is discussed, it may be important to track these
conversations as part of the official record (see "[Record Keeping of
User Interactions](#records)"). 

<a name="prepare"></a>

## Preparing for the Meeting

The initial meeting is an opportunity for the Facilitator to make a good
impression on behalf of the resource(s) providers and to build trust in
the researcher-Facilitator relationship. To ensure a productive
engagement, a Facilitator should take several steps for preparation in
advance. This will ensure that both the Facilitator and the researcher
get the most out of the meeting and that the researcher’s time is
respected, not to mention the fact that scheduling meetings with
faculty members can be challenging.

### Research

It is crucial that a Facilitator takes the time to learn about the need
for ACI resources in the researcher’s field of study prior to the actual
meeting. This may be accomplished by a simple review of any existing ACI
plans and previous issues/support tickets if available, along with a
review of the lab website, background on the current technologies in
their field, and what local resources are already provided for such
research. Doing so will establish Facilitator credibility in speaking
about relevant ACI advances for their field and will allow the
Facilitator to more quickly understand their research and ACI needs.

### Questions

An initial engagement is the perfect time to gather knowledge about the
science and research results that the researcher is currently pursuing
for which they require ACI resources. For inquiring about research and
resource needs, it is extremely helpful to have a list of prepared
questions. A list of basic initial engagement questions, as well as some
questions specifically geared toward compute center resources, is shown
below. 

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li> What are your current research projects?</li>
	    <ul>
		<li> What are the timelines of the projects?</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
	<li> What hardware resources are you currently using for computation? 
	    <ul>
 		<li> Do these meet your computational needs? </li>
  		<li> Are there things you can’t do with your current resource that you would like to? 
			(E.g., can you evaluate all the data you want to at the scale you want?)</li>
  		<li> Are you interested in using other resources? 
			(E.g., our local cluster or national resources.)</li>  
	    </ul>
	</li>
	<li> What software programs, packages, etc. are you using for your research?
	    <ul>
  		<li> Are there existing issues/limitations with the current software?</li>
  		<li> Is there software you would like to use? Is there a reason you are not currently using it?</li>
  	    </ul>
	</li>
	<li> What resource are you using for storage?
	    <ul>
  		<li> How much storage are you using?</li>
  		<li> How much storage will you need?</li> 
	  	<li> Is this the correct class of storage for your work?</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
	<li> Are there any roadblocks to the use of computation resources in your current research?
	    <ul>
  		<li> Network issues?</li>
  		<li> Knowledge/expertise?</li>
  		<li> Hardware?</li>  </ol></li>
		<li> Where do you see your research going in the future?</li>
	   </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
</div>

In addition to these basic tried-and-true questions, we recommend
developing some of your own questions to add to the template. In
principle, the questions will be aimed at prompting the researcher to
discuss their current and long-term research, their research computing
goals, what is blocking their current work, and what they would do if
they had the necessary resources. If the questions are sufficiently
prepared, providing them to the researcher prior to engagement meetings
also helps prime her/him for thinking critically about their
cyberinfrastructure needs and will result in a more productive
interaction.

### Resources

Another helpful item to have prepared in advance is a list of ACI
resources available for her/his use. It is possible your ACI group has
already compiled a list of the ACI tools and resources at your
institution that can be leveraged. If not, this is something a
Facilitator should do, for which the chapter on *[ACI Knowledge](../07-aci_knowledge)* can
provide ideas. Researchers may not know or understand all the options
that are immediately and locally available, and mentioning these can
prompt additional discussion about their research and directions that
they didn’t think about prior to the meeting. 

In addition to local resources, your list should include external ACI
resources that exist outside of the group to which the Facilitator
belongs. These might include regional and/or national resources that
scale beyond that which most individual institutions can achieve (e.g.,
XSEDE, Open Science Grid, iPlant, etc.) Since many Facilitators may not
work at a large resource-providing institution, it is to the benefit of
researchers to be made aware of all existing ACI resources available.

<a name="during"></a>

## During the Meeting

One cannot underestimate the importance of the first face-to-face
contact — the tone and success of this meeting sets the trajectory for
remaining interactions you will have with this individual or the research group. Remember that the primary purpose of the engagement meeting is to gather information; to that
end, there are eight key practices to keep in mind.


1. **_Be interested and positive_**. You want the researcher to leave the meeting 
feeling positive about the ACI Plan so they will be able to enact the plan for the 
greatest research impact.

2. **_Take notes_**. Good documentation allows this meeting to be
referenced in the future and will set the team up for success.

3. **_Actively listen_**. Everyone has a tendency to promote a
predetermined message when discussing something they are passionate
about and, in doing so, we sometimes forget to listen.

4. **_Identify roadblocks_**. If/when roadblocks are related to
some of the policies and procedures of the institution, make a note
without being negative or apologetic.

5. **_Describe the resource_**s. Explain the relative scale of relevant
ACI resources and what that scale enables. Often researchers are so
focused on past solutions and their current lab capabilities that they
miss the positive impacts of scaling up.

6. **_Make a plan_**. Whether a formal plan is required depends on the
complexity of the researcher’s needs. If needed, the ACI plan could be
created during the meeting or in some cases taken back to the ACI team
for additional development.

7. **_Engage others_**. Remember that the ACI team may not be able to
address the researcher's needs. Bringing in or a referral to another
resource or collaborator might be the appropriate solution. 

8. **_Explain technical jargon_**. It is impossible to avoid technical
jargon when discussing ACI. Try to be sensitive when using terms that
are not familiar to almost anyone else, and be proactive about
explaining these terms as you use them. Jargon changes over time and can
mean different things within different disciplines.

9. **_Research first, ACI second_**. It is easy to get carried away when
describing all your incredible ACI resources. Keep this urge in check while
you focus on determining the research objectives and goals. 

Whatever the method, the Facilitator and ACI team should always point
researchers to the most appropriate resource. While the
resources a Facilitator represents may be effective for many
cases, they may not be the best solution for all research needs. Be sure to utilize
your Facilitators network, such as ACI-REF, CaRC, and XSEDE Campus Champions, when you
have questions that cannot be addressed within your team.

<a name="conclude"></a>

## Concluding the Meeting

By the end of the meeting the Facilitator should have good comprehension
of the researcher’s work and goals, and devise some form of an ACI plan,
whether formal or informal. Prior to concluding this or any
meeting, it is important to review the actionable items which, in this
case, are within the ACI plan that the meeting has produced. A review
will focus everyone on the tasks ahead and set expectations on the items
to be done by each party. The practice of reviewing is key, as
individuals may otherwise leave a meeting with widely varying ideas and
expectations about future outcomes, so conclude with clear tasks and timelines. For example:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>"I will email or call by the end of next week."</li>
	<li>"The system administrator is going to setup an account on the cluster
by Thursday and will email you the account login information."  </li>
	<li>"I’ll send you an email by the end of the day summarizing everything
we’ve discussed and links to the web pages we went over today so you can
get started as soon as you’re ready."</li>
</ul>
</div>

After the engagement, the Facilitator can continue to assist the
researcher, bringing in other members of the ACI team as necessary (see
the *[Assisting Researchers in the Use of ACI Resources](../05-assistance)* chapter). In some
of the engagements, it will become apparent that the researcher requires
a course of action that is more complex. In these instances, it is ideal
to create an ACI plan (see *[Implementing an ACI Plan](../04-aci_plan)* for more
details) to document and organize all the major steps as one of the
engagement outcomes. This plan can be used to drive future assistance
and engagement meetings and aide in keeping the team organized for
specific tasks that relate to particular researchers. It provides a
framework to track tasks that block other tasks while highlighting
dependencies. In essence, an ACI plan is a blueprint or project
management document that fits your group’s workflows and procedures in a
way that allows you to organize and scale the team’s facilitation
activities.

# Finding Engagement Opportunities

Engagements are rarely initiated by the researchers, as typically they
are looking for assistance. Therefore, Facilitators are the ones to
identify potential engagements and initiate meetings. There are
several places to look at for making engagement conversions:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>Help-ticket reviews: Browsing through assistance tickets can point to
researchers that can benefit from a proactive engagement to discuss
accelerating their research.</li>
	<li>Email reviews: Browsing your emails and team emails for previous
assistance, introductions, and relevant information.</li>
	<li>Follow-ups from training sessions: Invitations to training attendees
for face-to-face follow-ups can drum up engagement opportunities.</li>
	<li>Survey responses: Surveys about services and trainings can point to
researchers that could benefit from an engagement.</li>
	<li>Referrals from other ACI and IT staff: Both solicited and unsolicited
referrals can be useful opportunities for
establishing an engagement. Meetings between local service providers
over researcher-related assistance requests or researchers observed
needing additional resources or help can often yield new leads.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

To provide the best ROI, Facilitators should proactively seek out
engagements and weekly tasks should include scheduled time to check for
new opportunities.


<a name="records"></a>

# Record Keeping of User Interactions

Documentation is one of the cornerstones of solid organization: Being
organized enables easier scaling to larger numbers of clients/researchers, in addition
to being able to share responsibilities among team members. To
this end, establishing a procedure to track/document researcher
interactions is important, especially as demand for Facilitation and ACI
resources increases. Many ACI groups have adopted a system
for user management and ticketing systems to handle account requests,
software installs, bugs etc. (see more in *[Assisting Researchers in the
Use of ACI Resources](../05-assistance)*). Documenting, tracking, and organizing your
interactions with users/researchers can be extensions of ticketing
activities in most ways, and most of the existing ACI-REF institutions
have integrated their email ticket systems into their engagement
documentation processes. However, there are additional features of
engagements and other user interactions for which an email ticketing
system may not be sufficient.

In this section we will cover how to develop documentation practices for
engagement  tracking that will integrate with common infrastructure and
documentation/tracking procedures to aid in organizing facilitation
engagements.

<a name="records-procedures"></a>

## Establishing Processes and Procedures

As mentioned, having a solid plan for how engagement interactions and
outcomes are will be documented and tracked is crucial. When developing
processes and procedures for documenting and tracking researcher
engagements there are a number of considerations. Some key items to
keep in mind when developing these processes and procedures are:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>Recognize how to reuse your solutions. Many times, the solutions for
one researcher’s problem may be applicable for others. Being able to
locate, search, and browse previous approaches is useful. </li>
<li>Envision how the documentation from your engagement meeting will
transition to action items and future interactions. For example: </li>
	<ul class="bullet-list-circle">
    		<li>Record any meeting notes into your system for review and historical reference. Others from your group will find the context useful and can look back at these notes to inform future interactions.</li>
		<li>Create assignable action items that can be tracked for progress. Consider how effort from the Facilitator and other ACI staff will need to scale.</li>
		<li>Schedule follow-up meeting, interactions, and communications.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Organize engagement documentation around a researcher and/or research
group. However you are tracking interactions, you may want to group
engagements and assistance with individual researchers in the context of
the central PI or group. This allows everything to be surveyed at once
in the future.</li>
<li>Keep email correspondence together, as part of the engagement
documentation.</li>
<li>Establish methods by which you can ensure balance between the effort
used in documentation and the efforts following implementation of an ACI
plan. Especially for complex use cases, there can be a tendency to go
overboard.</li>
<li>Obtain management buy-in on record keeping procedures. If you have to
devote a portion of time to documenting this information, ensure that
you can justify the effort for your procedures.</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with your institutional policies in regard to
information security and user information. Utilize your institution’s best practices
on where information about researchers is stored and how it is accessed.
For instance, can/should it be accessible from only within the
institution (i.e. web accessible)? In some of the current ACI-REF
institutions, this information is web accessible only with SSL
encryption and role-based access in place. Consult with your campus IT
or security team if you are unsure.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

Remember, one of the overall goals of creating this tracking system is
to convey a professional and organized appearance by capturing the
information necessary for research success. This overhead needs to be
balanced with the other duties of facilitating — keep in mind the
return on investment for each part of the process.

<a name="records-implement"></a>

## Implementation

The current ACI-REF institutions differ on implementation of engagement
and user tracking, but there are significant commonalities in features.
Leveraging existing tools, especially for assistance requests across IT
teams for resources like networking and storage is recommended to reduce
complexity and infrastructure (see the chapter on [Assistance](../05-assistance) for
additional ideas and information). Also, recognize that some of these
tools may be managed outside of your group, as is often common when
research computing ACI teams are tightly coupled with central IT.

Some infrastructure features that should be considered when implementing a tracking system:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>Centralized directory: A system that has a shared, centralized repository of user
information, including information about research goals, as well as any
ACI Plan(s).</li>
	<li>Flexible search capabilities: As more researcher information will
populate the system -- being able to find relevant references to
research activities easily is essential.</li>
	<li>Integration with your existing email ticket system:  Some
help ticketing systems have additional features or an API integration
point that could be useful. If an email help system is not currently in use,
adopting one is strongly recommended.</li>
	<li>Automated notification reminders: Review client information at set
intervals. This feature might prove useful as new ACI capabilities are
released that can benefit a researcher.</li>
	<li>Integration of assessment data: Most sites survey users before and
after trainings, or at periodic times. Being able to organize this
information is helpful especially in the context of a user’s research
(see the *Assessment/Metrics* chapter for more details).</li>
</ul>
</div>

Some of the tools being used to track engagements by the current ACI-REF institutions are:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>REDCap ([http://project-redcap.org](http://project-redcap.org/)) – the
Center for High Performance Computing at University of Utah has used this
tool to track engagements and interactions with researchers.</li>
	<li>Redmine ([http://redmine.org](http://redmine.org)) – the University of
Hawaii’s CI team has made use of this software development/project
management tool to organize and track ACI-REF projects and information.</li>
	<li>Basecamp ([https://basecamp.com/](https://basecamp.com/)) – the Center
for High Performance Computing University of Utah uses this for project
management. In some cases, Basecamp is used to coordinate tasks for a
portion of a researcher's ACI plan.</li>
	<li>The University of Wisconsin has an in-house web app for account
management, associating researchers with projects, and note-taking by
Facilitators and other staff. The data itself is stored in a database
and integrates with campus NetIDs for usernames of researches on campus.</li>
	<li>Service Now ([http://www.servicenow.com](http://www.servicenow.com)) -
USC utilizes SNOW as a university-wide ticketing system. They also use
USC-secure Google documentation to track more complex ACIREF engagements.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Regardless of the tools and procedures chosen to develop the tracking
system and tracking, it is important that the facilitation team
members utilize them consistently. If not, there will be
confusion, dropped tasks, and potentially lost credibility with
researchers. Additionally, if you are tracking any metrics or
information, a lack in consistency will result in unreliable results and
will hinder your efforts. With multiple facilitators on your
team, ensure that everyone is trained and understands the tracking
procedures that are in place. For an example of tracking and documenting an engagment see [Appendix 3.1](../../appendix/3.1-engagement-documentation)

<a name="records-metrics"></a>

## Metrics For Engagement Tracking

An additional goal for having a tracking system is to generate reporting
information for your organization, granting agencies, and any other
stakeholders. The tracking system can be a partial source for data
used to report on facilitation activities, as well as on
the impact of these activities. In regards to engagements, examples of
metrics to track include:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>Researcher information within department and research area</li>
	<li>Total number of engagements in a set period (monthly, yearly etc)</li>
	<li>Category/type of engagement</li>
	<li>Engagement conversions</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Be aware of how you can integrate this information into your assessment 
data and metrics in order to save time later  (see the
*Assessment & Metrics* chapter for recommended metrics for tracking and
other details).
