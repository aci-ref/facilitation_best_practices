# Introduction

Outreach is a core element of facilitation and is essential to promoting
awareness of ACI, including both the physical resources and the
expertise of the ACI team to the institutional research community.
Outreach can also be used to demonstrate the value these resources bring
to an institution and can be used as an opportunity to showcase the ACI
available and its use. Whether a Facilitator is part of a well
established or a newly formed ACI organization, outreach will be crucial
to the growth and long term success of the organization. Outreach goals
might include:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li>Describe how researchers can obtain access to ACI</li>
        <li>Increase awareness about ACI capabilities</li>
        <li>Discuss the applicability of available ACI solutions to research
projects</li>
        <li>Promote the existence and importance of Facilitators</li>
        <li>Demonstrate aspects of facilitation</li>
        <li>Highlight outcomes from the use of the ACI resources</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the return on the investment in ACI resources</li>
    </ul>
</div>


There are a variety of outreach avenues, and Facilitators should make
themselves aware of the ones available at their institution as well as
determining the way to best leverage each depending on the situation and
purpose. In this chapter, we will discuss different outreach
opportunities, describe ways to convey outreach messages, and provide
suggestions on effectively targeting key audiences. The result of
effective outreach will result in advocates for the ACI resources among
both the researchers and institutional leadership and administration.

# Target Audiences 

Outreach for ACI is most often geared towards researchers, including
both existing and potential users of ACI. In these cases, outreach will
generally revolve around describing ACI resources, including 
information on user policies and introductions of how to use specific
ACI systems, as well as the assistance that a Facilitator and ACI team
can provide. As ACI resources evolve over time, especially when the ACI
organization is well established, outreach can also be used to inform
the user base of changes to available resources, in policies and
processes, and in services or staffing, and to showcase the innovation
of the organization. Outreach events targeting the research community
can also be used as an avenue to obtain information on the evolving
needs of the user community.

An institution’s administration and other stakeholders are also an
important audience for outreach. ACI is a cornerstone for scientific
inquiry and therefore administrators, especially those who make
decisions regarding the funding of ACI should be informed regularly
about the use of ACI and the value it brings to the institution. This
may include the Chief Information Officer, Vice President or Provost of
Research, deans, department chairs, and even off-campus entities.
Information to communicate will include:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li>Use cases that highlight research efforts, especially those that have
a high visibility both at the institution and beyond</li>
<li>Updates on available ACI resources</li>
<li>Summary data on consultations and training sessions provided to the
research community</li>
<li>Usage of ACI, including measurements of growth and new use cases</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

Finally, there may be opportunities to highlight the research successes
and use cases of the ACI organization beyond the institution, such as at
conferences, cross-institutional communities, and promotional materials.
One example is the annual CASC (Coalition of Academic Scientific
Computation, casc.org) brochure, which solicits cases to be featured
from their member institutions. Participation in conferences such as the
annual SuperComputing conference is another way to showcase the usage of
ACI resources. Materials for such opportunities may include automated
slideshows of highlights, interactive demonstrations of usage, or 
handouts available at a booth; all are effective ways to provide talking
points for people, including Facilitators, manning the booth.

# Publicizing ACI Availability and Usage

Most campuses have a media or communications department that can be
utilized to help to promote awareness of the ACI organization.
Facilitators should become aware of the communication resources
available at their institution and cultivate relationships with the
staff of these organizations. The connections to the media and
communications staff members can be used not only to inform the research
community about resources available, but can also be used to highlight
the role that ACI resources played in a any prominent publications. This
can be done though the same methods discussed below in the section
"[Advertising the Event](#advertising)".

Facilitators should take every opportunity to cultivate advocates in
different places at an institution. Good advocates are people who have
experience with the use of the resources and with the facilitation
process; it helps if they have a specific use case on which to speak.
These supporters can be used to spread the word about the availability
of ACI resources and facilitation, and can be invited to outreach events
to help promote ACI. They can also be used to point the Facilitator at
additional opportunities for outreach that may exist. 

Facilitators should also be aware of other service providers on campus
that either provide ACI resources or that make use of ACI resources in
their service catalog, and check with them about outreach opportunities.
Some examples include:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li> At the University of Utah, the USTAR Center for Genomic Discovery
(UCGD) is supported by the campus’s centralized research computing
provider (CHPC). When the UCGD had a workshop for users of their
analysis pipeline, CHPC staff were invited to attend in order to allow
the users to meet the provider of computational resources behind the
pipeline. Facilitators at events like this one sometimes present
information on their ACI organization, but a  presence, alone, at these
events allows direct and indirect users of ACI resources to put a name
and face to the ACI provider and staff.</li>

</div>

<li>At the University of Hawaii, a research group that heavily utilizes
the UH ITS Cyberinfrastructure resources is working on mapping the ocean
biome invited the Cyberinfrastructure team to attend a research
coordination network meeting being held at UH and co-hosted with NSF
Earth-Cube. The Facilitators were able to gather information and network
with additional UH and collaborating researchers during the event. These
connections resulted in a partnership between the community and the ACI
team in future grant projects.</li>

</div>

<li>At the University of Wisconsin, Facilitators have met with the campus
group of research grant administrators to inform them of campus ACI
services, so that these individuals can help researchers to connect with
appropriate ACI resources and Facilitators when applying for funding.
Beyond outreach events that researchers already attend, Facilitator-like
individuals across a variety of ACI and non-ACI campus services
regularly meet with each other to stay abreast of resources and
facilitate the hand-off of researchers between service providers.</li>
</ul>

# Partnering with Existing Events

Participating in existing events at an institution can help an ACI
organization reach new and diverse audiences, and can be easier than
creating an event solely for the purpose of promoting awareness of ACI
resources. Thus, researching existing activities at the institutional or
departmental levels is a good place to start with outreach. For
activities at the division or department level, ask existing ACI users
and their ITS or department directors about upcoming or regular events.
At the institutional level, check with centers for faculty and research
support. For initial contact, reaching out to  existing communications
groups at any of these levels, can also be a good place to start.
Utilizing existing, regularly scheduled meetings such as those discussed
below has the distinct advantage that the individuals involved already
have the meeting on their calendars and therefore the Facilitator does
not have to arrange for a time that works with multiple schedules. In
addition, the location of the meeting is also already determined, and
therefore there is no requirement to find an suitable location.

For a Facilitator in an academic setting, established events that can be
leveraged for outreach include, but are not limited to, faculty
candidate visits, new faculty orientation, graduate student
orientations, departmental seminars, departmental faculty meetings,
graduate or undergraduate seminar classes, and research group meetings.
There may also be existing events that specifically showcase research
and/or research tools at which a Facilitator may be able to have a table
or make a presentation. A Facilitator can also check if there are focus
groups on campus and reach out to schedule meetings to explore potential
needs for ACI. Another avenue is for a Facilitator to offer to guest
lecture in a class that is making use of the ACI resources in order to
assist the class as they start to use the resource. A Facilitator can
also reach out to instructors of classes covering ACI relevant subject
matter that might be interested in having the class here about resources
available, even if the resources are not being used for the class. Each
of these reaches a different audience, but all are important venues for
the successful promotion of the availability of ACI.

# Organizing an ACI Event

Often a Facilitator will be called upon to organize outreach events for
their respective ACI organization. There are a multitude of event types
that can be effective in promoting ACI and the facilitator role, and the
choice of event type depends greatly on the ACI organization and local
culture. In this section we will present a number of events that have
worked for the institutions involved in creating this document.

<div class="captioned">
<img class="captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ResearcherImpact.jpg" alt="Research Impact Event">

Wisconsin's Center for High Throughput Computing.
</div>

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li><b>Data Center Tours:</b> Tours of the ACI facility can serve as an
opportunity to demonstrate to researchers the level of service provided.</li>

<li><b>Research Impact Event:</b> Events may be organized to highlight 
cyberinfrastructure's role in computational research, at which users can 
showcase their research to one another. A related option is to focus
the day on a specific aspect of CI. As an example, Clemson University has run a
"GIS Day" to promote GIS resources and GIS based research on campus.</li>

<li><b>Seminar Series:</b> This type of outreach can be used to highlight
uses of ACI resources and perhaps also lead to collaborations
between research efforts. The ACI organization can sponsor periodic
seminars that focus on research outcomes obtained with the use of
their resources.</li>

<li><b>Vendor presentation:</b> These can be used to promote the availability
of a specific tool or resource that the ACI provider already has or may
acquire. A number of the vendors such as NVidia, Mathworks, and Ansys
offer to to hold such events on campuses.</li>

<li><b>ACI Resource Announcements:</b> An outreach session can be held in
conjunction with the announcement of a new ACI resource or a change in
usage and accompanying policy. Facilitators can
incorporate additional outreach about pre-existing resources as well.</li>

<li><b>Annual User Meetings:</b> An annual meeting or open forum can be
scheduled to have a dialog with researchers on the status of the ACI
organization and the resources and services provided.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="advertising"></a>

## Advertising the Event

The most effective way to promote an event will depend on the desired
audience. Consider how the target audience usually receives information
about these types of events, and try to leverage existing infrastructure
which may include email lists (user base, departments, colleges, other
related service providers, etc), web sites, and social media such as
Twitter and Facebook. Flyers advertising the event should be physically
posted several weeks in advance in different locations, left in
reception areas, and emailed to recipients so they can post them in
additional locations. As mentioned earlier, campus-level communications
units might also assist in promoting the event. Attendance might be
motivated for any of the above event types by advertising snacks, swag,
or by requiring an RSVP.

<a name="appearing"></a>

# Appearing at Events

As with any time a Facilitator represents their ACI organization, it is
important to do so in a professional manner. In many cases, this may 
be the first interaction that members of the audience have with the ACI
organization, so it is essential to make a good impression.
Several points to keep in mind when preparing for the event and putting
together materials are:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li class="list-checkbox"><b><i>Be prepared:</i></b>  Arrive early to make sure all is set up
properly, especially when using new devices and technologies, or reusing
for the first time in a while. Anticipate questions that may come from
the audience, and try to address the most important answers in the
materials.</li>

<li class="list-checkbox"><b><i>Know the audience:</i></b>   Research the details of the event and design
materials accordingly. For events where there will be repeated one on
one or one to a small group, such as when manning a booth or a table,
prepare an initial "engagement speech" appropriate for the venue.</li>

<li class="list-checkbox"><b><i>Engage the audience:</i></b>  Think about ways to draw in the anticipated
audience. It may be worth doing something 'atypical' to draw
attention. For example, when manning a booth or a table at a larger
event, don't underestimate the value of swag! Depending on the venue,
visual materials might include handouts, slide shows of use cases, even
live demonstrations using the resources. Be sure to have additional
information readily available to address more in-depth questions.</li>

<li class="list-checkbox"><b><i>Provide Contact Information:</i></b> In all outreach events, as well as
materials used in education and training, it is essential to include
information on where to get more information and ways to contact the
presenter and/or other members of the ACI organization.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="materials"></a>

# Construction of Reusable Materials

Independent of the target audience and the venue, the goal of any
outreach activity is to provide information on the ACI resource and/or
to make the audience aware that Facilitators and other staff at from the
ACI organization are available to provide assistance. It is very useful
to keep a set of current outreach materials that can be reused, or that
can at least be the basis for future outreach activities. Some examples
of reusable materials are described below.

It is important to make sure that outreach materials are regularly
reviewed and updated frequently to ensure that accurate information is
provided. For example, updates should be made when there are changes
made in the resources, and when new information on usage becomes
available.

<a name="slides"></a>

## Slide based presentations

Presentations are generally the most commonly used approach in outreach
at most institutions, as they are useful when presenting to a group and
as they work in a number of different settings. Typically the larger the
audience and the more formal the event is, the more important it is to
have a presentation prepared in advance. It is useful to have multiple
sets of slides that cover different aspects of the ACI resource or
organization, from which to choose depending on the focus of the
presentation, the audience, and the time available. An outreach based
presentation can be used as a lead-in presentation in an educational and
training presentation series, in order to introduce the audience to the
resources that will be discussed in future presentations in the series.
Alternately it can be a stand-alone presentation given to an group
interested in learning more about the ACI resources available and how
they are used.

There exist many on-line sources that can be accessed by googling topics
such as "pointers for good presentations" or “pointers for effective
presentations”. These focus on all aspects of doing a presentation, from
determining the content, to creating the slides, to giving the
presentation. These sources also include pointers on adjusting
presentations to fit the venue, audience, and occasion, as well as tips
on how to improve your skill as a presenter.

<a name="posters"></a>

## Posters

<div class="captioned">
<img class="captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/CHPCPoster2017.png" alt="ACI Resource Poster">
Example poster from the University of Utah's Center for High Performance Computing.
</div>

A poster with highlights of either the resources available or a use
case, or both, is another valuable tool to use when doing outreach. This
can be either a printed poster, or can be a monitor showing a slideshow
of use cases and informational materials. While often these are created
for an external event, they can also be displayed at the ACI
organization, especially when the location is one that is visited by the
user base and any visitors to the organization. A Facilitator or any
other ACI staff can use these as talking points on the ACI resource and its usage when meeting with either
established or new users.

<a name="handouts"></a>

## Handouts

One page handouts or brochures are often useful either as stand-alone
outreach tools or as supplemental materials for other outreach efforts.
When talking to potential or new users, such as new faculty candidates,
these can detail the resources available and where to get more
information in an easy-to-consume format. The goal is to provide
sufficient details on what resources are available and also provide
directions to get more information. Alternately, handouts might include
facts such as growth in usage, numbers of training event attendees,
and/or number of research grants and publications supported; these data
can be used effectively to demonstrate the return on investment to
administration and other funding stakeholders. In either case, these
fact sheets should focus on multiple aspects of ACI, including human
support in addition to physical resources.

<a name="use-case"></a>

## Use Case Stories

Along with fact sheets, use cases are a very effective outreach tool.
These can be short write-ups of success stories made possible due to the
availability of ACI resources, especially very visible successes such as
those published in high-impact journals or one that have received
substantial press coverage. Examples of ACI successes are especially
useful when justification the implementation of an ACI resource. Where
appropriate, success stories should also feature the role the
Facilitators or other ACI staff and can be featured on the ACI
organization website.

<a name="newsletters"></a>

## Newsletters

<div class="captioned">
<img class="captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/CHPC_NewsFall2017.png" alt="Example Newsletter">
Example newsletter.
</div>

Newsletters are another way to present multiple pieces and types of
information in a succinct form. These can be produced on a regular
schedule and distributed to the users and institutional leadership, via
email and/or printed copy. Facilitators can use the distribution of a
printed newsletter as a reason to visit with existing users and
administration. Any newsletters published should also be made available
electronically on the ACI organization website. When providing content,
keep in mind that with some topics it is often sufficient to provide a
short blurb with a link to a location providing more detailed
information, allowing the reader to make a decision if the topic is of
interest or applicable to them. As an example,  in recent editions of
the University of Utah’s Center for High Performance biannual newsletter
a section on "What’s new at CHPC" consisting of a series of two or three
sentence highlights about items such as minor policy changes, new
documentation, growth of resources, and new tools.

<a name="tracking"></a>

# Tracking Outreach and Measuring Effectiveness

While the gathering of metrics and assessment data is discussed in more
detail in the chapter on **Assessment and Metrics**, a few
considerations specific to collecting data on outreach activities are
presented in this section.

As with other aspects of the Facilitator role, it is important to
carefully track various outreach efforts. This involves keeping detailed
records of the event, including information such as:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li>Date of event</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Type of event</li>
<li>Target audience</li>
<li>Number of attendees</li>
</ul>
</div>


The above information can be used when deciding the value of holding the
same or similar events in the future, as well as being a source of
information for reporting on various outreach activities. In addition,
tools such as Google Analytics can be utilized to assess online
advertising methods used and the value of other online outreach content.

Along with recording the metrics of the event, it is also important to
get as sense of the effectiveness of the event, in order to determine
whether or not the outreach achieved the goal. There are a number of
ways to measure the effectiveness, and these are not only applicable to
outreach activities, but also to the similar *[Education and Training](../06-education)*
activities of a Facilitator. One approach, most valid when the
outreach activity is a presentation, is to give the attendees a short
written survey. It is best for surveys of this type to be short and easy
to complete in order to get the attendees to take the time to complete
them.

Along with gathering of metrics at a given outreach event, there are
also ways to survey new users regarding how they’ve heard about the
relevant ACI resources, including any outreach opportunities they’ve
experienced.

Feedback on the effectiveness of an outreach activity can also be
obtained by reaching out to one or more of the attendees of the
activity, either with a written survey or in a one-on-one meeting. This
type of feedback can often provide a higher level of detail, and can be
done in an open-ended manner, with the responses to any single question
leading to follow up questions and discussion.

Finally, it is essential that the Facilitator take time to reflect upon
the outreach activity and record their own observations on the event.
Some questions to consider when doing this are:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
        <li>Was the outreach activity appropriate for the target audience?</li>
<li>What part of the outreach did or did not work?</li>
<li>What should be changed before doing a similar event?</li>
</ul>
</div>


Along with the observations made by the Facilitator themselves, it is
also helpful to have a colleague attend the event and offer the same
type of feedback as well as a critique. Doing so can provide a different
view of the activity. Facilitators and other staff performing outreach
should approach this process with an open mind and be prepared to accept
any critique as a way to be more effective in future outreach efforts.
This can be equally effective for Facilitators who are new to the role
as well as more experienced Facilitators who may want to reconsider
their normal way of doing outreach.

Whether one of these assessment methods or several are chosen, it is
essential that a Facilitator takes the time to carefully consider the
feedback and incorporate it in future outreach efforts, both in the
planning of future events as well as in the content of the event.
Furthermore, this information is valuable to exchange with others that
share in the outreach efforts, so that the lessons learned by one
individual are not lost and can be used as a learning experience for
multiple people.
