<a name="introduction"></a>
<h1> Introduction</h1>

Assisting researchers as they actively use ACI is a key component of
facilitation, especially if the Facilitator is directly associated with
one or more specific ACI services, or when researchers require outside
resources. Whether researchers are already leveraging an ACI resource or
have just gained access, they should be be able to easily obtain ongoing
assistance from Facilitators and other ACI support staff with respect
to:

<ul>
<li>questions about ACI capabilities and use </li>
<li>requests for help with issues</li>
<li>needs for learning materials </li>
<li>requests for engagement consultations or other guidance for new ideas </li>
<li>obtaining assistance for external ACI resources</li>
</ul>

Therefore, an essential component of providing assistance is to
establish consistent and accessible routes by which users can obtain
assistance and to establish a set of effective communication practices.
As described later in this chapter, assistance communication should
strive to be as clear as possible, regardless of the assistance route,
and present solutions that advance a researcher’s own future
capabilities in using ACI resources. We also discuss the importance of
translating assistance experiences into improvements to learning
materials (see also *[Education and Training of Researchers](../06-education)*) and into
optimization of ACI system capabilities to better meet researcher needs
(covered in *[Interfacing with ACI Resource Providers](../09-interface)*).

For the purpose of distinguishing the information in this chapter from
that in Engaging Researchers, we define “assistance” as the one-to-one
or one-to-few support of researchers already accessing an ACI resource,
where the support pertains directly to their specific practices in using
that resource. Assistance may follow from an engagement, especially if
the engagement results in the researcher using ACI for the first time.
It is also important to note that some interactions with researchers may
be a combination of engagement and assistance, or may transition from
one to another. For example, assistance discussions lead to a
redefinition of the ACI Plan and/or the need for another ACI resources
is recognized. As described above, assistance routes are also an
important avenue by which a researcher may request a new engagement
meeting.

<a name="routes"></a>
<h1>Establishing Communication Routes for Providing Assistance</h1>

To effectively support researchers in their use of ACI resources, a set
of routes by which researchers can obtain assistance should be
well-advertised. It is crucial to utilize multiple established
communication routes for assistance when the Facilitator most directly
supports a specific ACI resource (a campus computing center, for
example). Facilitators should also be aware of and clearly identify
external assistance resources, especially those of external ACI
resources (e.g., other institutional ACI resources, national computing
centers, commercial cloud services, etc.). Below, we discuss the
implementation and applicability of several communication routes for
providing assistance, and later discuss effective communication
strategies.

<a name="routes-common"></a>
<h2>Common Assistance Routes</h2>

While each of the below communication routes for providing assistance is
powerful on its own, it is valuable to have multiple routes from which
to choose to cater to various situations and researcher preferences. At
the same time, it is a good strategy to avoid having too many routes, so
as not to overwhelm researchers with the number of choices and so that
the options are clear to researchers.

<h3>Email and email-based ticket systems</h3>

In comparison to other assistance routes, email is often best for
addressing issues that can be easily understood and whose solutions can
be readily communicated without the need for significant back-and-forth
conversation. Email contact is also the most common gateway to other
assistance routes, especially when contact is initiated by the
Facilitator. Finally, email follow-ups can and should be used after
providing assistance to a researcher via one of the *other* assistance
routes, in order to recap the conversation and to document specific
details that the researcher may not have recorded or remembered.

Many ACI organizations leverage an email-based ticket or other issue
tracking system for managing and responding to user support requests.
This approach typically provides a convenient, single point of access
for email-based support requests from users, allow a consolidated view
of past issues and requests, and come with built-in features for ease of
collecting metrics. Alternatives include the use of a single, dedicated
email address monitored by one or more Facilitators and possibly other
ACI staff, as long as the ownership of each new request can be made
clear among these staff. Typically, individual staff email addresses are
much less effective and add unnecessary confusion for users, especially
if there are multiple individuals providing assistance or when staffing
changes occur. Furthermore, the use of individual email addresses often
leads to confusion between multiple Facilitators when assisting the same
user(s), over time, and can impede the collection of metrics.

<h3>Scheduled appointments</h3>

There are times when email (or any other assistance route) may be
insufficient, such that a scheduled, and preferably in-person, meeting
is necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to, issue
troubleshooting that would require many back-and-forth emails, instances
where a researcher isn’t sure how to start using an ACI resource or how
to explain their problem, and even a researcher’s preference for
in-person communication instead of email. Effective in-person meetings
draw on many of the same practices as for engagements, including: 

* selecting a meeting location that is accessible to the researcher
* understanding the full problem or question from a researcher before beginning to pursue solutions
* clearly communicating and explaining next steps 
* making sure to follow-up with the researcher, as appropriate

Additionally, and distinct from practices typical to an engagement, it
is most effective to have a researcher execute a solution for
themselves, rather than only demonstrating the solution while the
researcher watches. Assistance meetings (and office hours, below) have
an added benefit over email communication in that they allow
Facilitators a unique look into the regular practices and hiccups of ACI
users when working side-by-side (see [^1], for more on
pair programming benefits). Furthermore, in-person contact provides many
more communication context clues, with the visual recognition of facial
expressions and body language. However, scheduled video and telephone
calls may be necessary if an in person meeting is problematic (see
further below).

As a reminder, many scheduled meetings may involve assistance for
specific tasks *and* discussion of ACI planning, or may transition from
one to the other. 

<h3>Office hours</h3>

Regularly scheduled office hours are often an effective complement to
other assistance routes, especially if the assistance conversation may
not warrant the scheduling of a special meeting but would still benefit
from in-person communication that might otherwise take multiple emails.
Furthermore, office hours cater to user preferences for face-to-face
communication, and allow researchers to drop in without the waiting time
that may be necessary for a scheduled, dedicated meeting. Office hours
are most effective when provided at consistent and convenient times, and
in accessible locations. This may mean that office hours are held at
different times, on different days of the week, or in different
locations on different days of the week, in order to maximize the
likelihood that at least one of the office hours slots and locations
will work for a given researcher.

Depending on the popularity of office hours, it may be necessary to have
multiple facilitators (or similar individuals) at a given session, or to
have other ACI staff prepared to assist should office hours become too
busy for a sole person. As office hours are otherwise very similar to
scheduled meetings in that they are usually executed in a face-to-face
manner, the best practices of assisting an individual researcher are the
same for both, while acknowledging the potential need for juggling more
than one researcher’s concerns at the same time during office hours.

<h3>On-demand options (chat, phone, etc.)</h3>

With the popularity of new technologies and social media, there are a 
number of other routes which have been effectively leveraged for
providing assistance to researchers needing support. For example, chat
rooms and messaging services can be leveraged with a hybrid set of best
practices drawing from email and in-person assistance. Phone calls may
be effective when email is perceived to be insufficient and when a
convenient location for in-person assistance is not possible. These and
other less common routes not discussed here can be implemented,
according to the Facilitator’s best judgement regarding applicability
and best practices, drawing on similarities with the
previously-described routes. 

As technology preferences and other factors shift researcher and
Facilitators practices toward additional assistance routes, the set of
most common and recommended routes described here should be amended, but
with the same goal of providing the most effective support to ACI users.
Across the various communication pathways for providing assistance, and
regardless of the purpose of the communication  – follow-up with user,
resolving user issues, proactive support – there are a number of best
practices for providing assistance that are covered further below in
"[Effective Communication in Assisting Researchers](#communication)". 

<a name="routes-awareness"></a>
<h2>Promoting Awareness of Assistance Routes</h2>

Just as it is important to promote awareness of ACI resources and
facilitation services to researchers (as described in *[Outreach](../02-outreach)*), it is
also essential to adequately document and promote the ways that
researchers can obtain assistance from Facilitators (and/or other ACI
staff). Typically, this information can be listed alongside in-house
learning materials and troubleshooting documentation on a website (see
*[Education and Training of Researchers](../06-education)*). For example, it may be effective
to provide a dedicated web page discussing the routes via which
assistance can be pursued, and to remind researchers of support
mechanisms within *other* online documentation pages. Furthermore, the
options for assistance should also be discussed during engagements and
in follow-up correspondence, perhaps as part of the ACI Plan
communicated to the researcher. Additionally, discussion of available
assistance routes may be included in outreach materials, in part, to
demonstrate the extent of support for researchers who might need to
leverage ACI in the future.

<a name="communication"></a>
<h1>Effective Communication in Assistance Interactions</h1>

Regardless of the assistance route, and in order to establish trust in
the Facilitator, assistance communication should be clear to the
researcher and be performed in a professional manner. Furthermore, as
the primary goal of facilitation is to truly accelerate research,
assistance strategies should clearly communicate approaches and
solutions that will enhance each researcher’s capabilities in the use of
ACI resources and empower the researcher to achieve more into the
future. We discuss below these overall considerations, which apply to
multiple assistance contexts covered below,
including "[Addressing User-reporting Issues](#issues)", 
"[Assistance for Non-issue Support Requests](#non-issue)", and 
"[Proactive Support](#proactive)".

As Facilitators will often rely on assistance participation or input
from other ACI staff, it is crucial that they strive to ensure that
their fellow ACI staff maintain these same standards of practice when
communicating with researchers. Often, Facilitators can be a crucial,
clarifying, and resounding voice by remaining involved when issue
resolution is taken on by another staff member.

<a name="communication-professional"></a>
<h2>Professionalism and Empathy in Assistance Communication</h2>

Regardless of the assistance route, it is important to distinguish
assistance and other communication with researchers from internal-issue
communication between ACI staff. Doing so fosters better relationships
and a two-way, “beyond the help desk,” communication culture that is
more akin to collaboration between colleagues. Such a distinction is
central to establishing a supportive relationship and is essential to
the role of Facilitators. Beyond professionalism, a colleague-like
relationship with researchers is also best achieved by treating
researchers and their potential misunderstandings with respect and
empathy.

Because each researcher has a unique background of experience with and
understanding of ACI concepts, assistance communication should recognize
this uniqueness and strive to instill confidence of the researcher in
their own abilities and in the Facilitator. Empathy for the difficulty a
researcher may face in learning ACI skills is one of the arguments for
Facilitators themselves to possess experience with implementing ACI
resources for research projects (see more about peer instruction in
[^2] and [^1]). Rather than discouraging
the researcher from asking questions that they might believe to be
naive, assistance practices should encourage researchers to seek more
answers in a combination approach of learning for themselves and being
comfortable in seeking assistance in the appropriate circumstances.

The importance of professionalism and empathy is often overlooked in
email communication for user support. It is therefore important to
follow typical practices for professional email communication, including
the use of greetings and introducing your name and role in the email
body and/or closing signature. Good examples of this are shown below,
under the topics of “[Addressing User-Reported Issues](#issues)” and 
“[Assistancefor Non-Issue Support Requests](#non-issue)”. Even for messages 
sent via email-based
issue “ticket” systems, where there may be a tendency to leave out
greetings and closing statements, it is important to treat communication
with users with more formalism than the styles culturalized in email
communication between ACI staff. For this reason, the Facilitator and
ACI service provider may find it useful to separate internal
communication from that used to communicate with researchers, perhaps by
using separate ticket queues. Furthermore, any communication that would
demean a researcher for misunderstanding or lack of knowledge, or that
might discourage researchers from pursuing assistance in the future,
should be strictly avoided.

<a name="communication-clarity"></a>
<h2>Achieving Clarity in Complex Assistance Discussions</h2>

A primary impetus for the assistance role of Facilitators is that
researchers often benefit significantly by having a translator of
complex concepts and terminology when learning to effectively utilize
ACI resources. To this end, Facilitators must strive to find language
that is already familiar to researchers, *especially* for assistance
communication. As discussed more thoroughly in 
*[Educating and Training Researchers](../06-education)*, 
education research indicates that non-experts are more
effective in teaching concepts that are novel to learners, as teachers
with greater expertise already possess a more sophisticated
understanding and set of terminology (see [^4] and 
[^5] for more discussion on this topic).

Other specific guidelines for clear wording in any communication context are:

* Describe concepts succinctly and in the simplest terms possible. It’s 
often useful to re-read and consolidate or shorten written information before sending.
* Use specific nouns to identify relevant items and concepts (e.g. “the submit file”, 
“your software”, “the file transfer rate”), and avoid less-specific pronouns as much 
as possible (e.g. “it”, “they”, “them”).
* Avoid jargon specific to an expert understanding and strive to find terminology 
that is familiar to the researcher. For example, use “program” or “software” if 
the word “executable” is less familiar.
* Avoid overwhelming the researcher with too much new information at once. 
Please see *[Educating and Training Researchers](../06-education)* in the Use of ACI, [^4],
 [^7], and [^8] for more 
 discussion on concept/cognitive overload.
* When introducing new terminology and ideas, as necessary define terms and 
provide distinction from other concepts. For example, “the submit file, 
which will be separate from the BLAST alignment program you wish to run 
within each job ...”.
* Minimize the use of acronyms by limiting these to terms that are: (1)
 already familiar to the researcher, and/or (2) have been sufficiently defined 
 and used previously in non-acronym forms.

Facilitators may benefit from a plethora of existing literature and
professional development opportunities to develop excellent
communication skills. In later sections, below, we elaborate more on assistance
approaches that are more specific to assisting with issues, reaching
beyond effective communication to include strategies for selecting
solutions and recommendations.

<a name="communication-advance"></a>
<h2>Assistance Strategies that Advance Researcher Capabilities</h2>

As previously stated, a key role of a Facilitator is to enable
researchers to achieve more for themselves than they might have thought
possible, and than might have been achievable with a purely help-desk,
or reactive and issue-focused strategy of support. For the Facilitator,
this often means pursuing assistance that teaches a research to “fish
for her/himself”. Rather than directly solving issues for the researcher
or only suggesting easy to implement, short term solutions, Facilitators
should strive to identify and recommend solutions that enable
researchers to accomplish more and to imagine greater research
possibilities, in the long term. The communication of solutions should
be presented, as much as possible, as a form of guided
instruction.[^9]

To achieve the proper balance and to assist researchers in deciding for
themselves which solutions to pursue in various cases, there are a
number of specific strategies that effective Facilitators should
implement. Firstly, it is important to consider various options relative
to both the researcher’s immediate needs and long-term goals.
Additionally, the Facilitator should explain reasons for recommending a
specific solution over others, especially when an easier, but less
impactful solution may already be apparent. Facilitators should also
explain their level of confidence in the researcher’s ability to
implement various approaches or solutions, potentially based upon
demonstrated success from other research examples, and should provide
clear suggestions that the researcher can follow to achieve and assess
stepwise success.

Beyond explaining solutions, Facilitators can also improve the
researcher’s capabilities by teaching them how to troubleshoot and seek
answers for themselves in the future. Beyond explaining the
Facilitator’s thought process in determining appropriate solutions, a
Facilitator can establish examples of useful information sources,
including in-house learning materials and information sources (online or
elsewhere) deemed to be effective and trustworthy by the Facilitator and
other staff. Additionally, Facilitators can check in proactively when
issues or optimization opportunities are detected by various ACI staff
from usage metrics (as described further in "[Proactive Support](#proactive)").

<a name="issues"></a>
<h1>Addressing User-Reported Issues</h1>

Although the nature of issues reported by users of ACI resources will
vary significantly between resource type, the basic practical steps for
troubleshooting and problem-solving are fairly general: seek evidence,
diagnose, identify and test solutions or workarounds, and implement
and/or communicate solutions. Regardless of whether an issue is simple,
such as an easy-to-fix user error, or one which requires significant
effort from ACI staff, there are several basic steps for communicating
solutions and for capitalizing on assistance requests for teaching
opportunities. 

<a name="issues-clarify"></a>
<h2>Clarify the User’s Problem </h2>

Assistance-providers may first need to interpret the researcher’s
reported problem by asking any clarifying questions and by stating the
problem back to the researcher before proceeding further. This step will
confirm the issue with the researcher and may train the researcher to
provide pertinent details of what they observe early on in future help
requests. If multiple problems were reported, or the Facilitator
perceives that there may be more than one issue at play, these should be
stated and addressed, separately.

<a name="issues-identify"></a>
<h2>Identify Issue(s) and Appropriate Solution(s)</h2>

After the user’s problem has been clarified, typical problem solving
steps can be followed to identify the source of the problem and to
evaluate solutions.  This process may require the involvement of other
ACI staff or further input from the researcher. First, evidence of the
issue should be identified with help from the researcher, perhaps by
examining user files, user-provided error messages or file contents,
and/or indicators in system log files and metrics. After determining the
reason for the issue, it may be necessary to reproduce it, depending on
the exact problem, context, and precedents, and to potentially involve
other ACI staff. If a solution is not immediately obvious, and/or
requires more work, it may be necessary to provide the researcher with
an update, in order to communicate a potential resolution timeline.

<a name="issues-communicate"></a>
<h2>Communicate Next Steps to the User</h2>

After selecting a solution for the issue, the Facilitator should
communicate this solution to the researcher, making sure to clearly
describe steps for implementing the solution. The source of the issue
should be explained clearly in order to provide context for the
effectiveness of a chosen solution. When more than one solution may be
appropriate, the Facilitator should explain reasons for suggesting a
specific solution. It may also be appropriate, and will certainly
enhance the user’s own future capabilities, to prepare the researcher
for potential, related issues that might arise in the future.
Importantly, such discussion should still be limited to a scope that
will not overwhelm the researcher with too much information, and
suggesting a follow-up meeting may be beneficial to ensure the best,
stepwise progression for solving a complex issue.

The following is an example of the above practices in an email
communication with a researcher:

Example 1: Email from researcher regarding file transfer

~~~
------------------------ 
Hello, I tried to use ‘scp’ to copy data to my 
user directory on host1.org.univ.edu, but I get a “Permission denied”
error.  Is something wrong with my account? 
-John Scientist
------------------------ 
Hi John, Thank you for writing to us with this
question. In order to understand why your scp command isn’t working, can
you send me the exact command you’re using and the terminal output when
you run the command? From what I can tell, there doesn’t seem to be
anything wrong with your account, but we’ll figure out what’s not
working.

Thank you, 
Michelle Facilitator 
Research Computing Facilitator, CHTC
------------------------- 
Hi Michelle, Here are the lines from my
terminal: 
JohnDesktop:~ JohnSl$ scp myfile host1.org.univ.edu:/home/jscientist 
jscientist@host1.org.univ.edu's password: 
scp: /home/jscientist/myfile: Permission denied

-John 
------------------------ 
Hi John, 

Ah. I think I see what’s wrong.
When you use ‘scp’ from your desktop, the ‘scp’ program assumes that
you’ll be connecting as your Desktop username (“JohnS”) unless you
specify that your username on the server is different.  Our own guide
for file transfer has some examples explaining this behavior and other
scp features (org.univ.edu/guides/filetransfer.html), and there is even
more information online if you Google something like “scp guides”.

Here’s a command that should work for you: 
scp myfile jscientist@host1.org.univ.edu:/home/jscientist

Thank you, 
Michelle Facilitator 
Research Computing Facilitator, CHTC

<a name="issues-communicate"></a>
<h2>Record communication for re-use</h2>

Some issues are reported more frequently than others.
Solutions for these common issues must be
recorded in an easily accessible location, for instance,
in the “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) section of the
documentation for the ACI resource.
It should be made clear to users that
this location must be consulted before request for assistance,
but these issues may be reported in assistance routes nevertheless.
Other issues may still require examination on a case-by-case basis,
but may need only minor “tweaks” for each user.
It is important that the Facilitator identifies such recurring issues,
and prepares a “template” communication that can be reused each time.
Tools like [Canned Responses](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/10/new-in-labs-canned-responses.html)
may be very useful for this.

Jump to: [top](#toc)

<a name="non-issue"></a>
<h1>Assistance for Non-Issue Support Requests</h1>

Often, users may contact Facilitators to discuss questions about ACI
options, capabilities, and modes of use. Typically these questions
differ from assisting with issues in that the user hasn’t encountered a
specific difficulty in using an ACI system, but may instead have more
general, proactive questions that can be addressed with targeted
clarification and guidance, or for which existing education and training
materials will be sufficient.

Examples of non-issue requests can include: 

1. What is the best way to run software “X” on the compute system? 
2. How much data can I store? 
3. Does anything on campus support my ACI need for “X”? 
4. I’m about to start on a project and I wanted to ask about “X”.

When addressing such questions, a slightly different approach for
information exchange may be appropriate, as demonstrated in the below
steps, though the overall process is still very similar in some ways to
issue resolution. Some non-issue questions may actually lead to a true
engagement, where a more complex ACI plan can be discussed. However, the
progression to deciding an engagement is necessary would still follow
the first few steps below, and according to practices described in
*[Engaging Researchers](03-engagement)*. As a clear demonstration, we provide two simple
examples of email communication for non-issue requests, though the same
ideas would apply within the context of other assistance route(s).

<a name="non-understand"></a>
<h2>Understand the User’s Most-immediate Question(s)</h2>

After receiving a non-issue question from a researcher, it is important
to fully understand the researcher’s intent and the scope of information
they’re seeking, within the context of what the Facilitator already
knows about the researcher’s relevant ACI knowledge, as is demonstrated
in the following exchange:

Example 2: Email from Researcher regarding the use of research computing resources

~~~
------------------------
Hello,
How do I run Matlab on multiple processors?
-Jane Biologist
------------------------
Hi Jane,
Thank you for writing to us with this question. I believe this will be 
your first time running Matlab jobs at our center. Are you wondering how 
to run many Matlab jobs at once, where each might use a different processor, 
or how to run a single Matlab job that utilizes multiple processors? 

I can even help point you in the best direction if you can explain a bit 
about what your Matlab program is doing, in terms of your research, and how 
it is using input data? Additionally, how might this work expand for you 
in the future if you could get it running efficiently in our compute systems?

Thank you,
Michelle Facilitator
Research Computing Facilitator, CHTC
-------------------------
Hi Michelle,
I would like to run my Matlab script that simulates genetic variability at 
least 1000 times, where each simulation uses the same genetic variation file 
and a unique set of parameters from my parameter file. This many simulations 
would take more than a week on my Mac, and I know that Matlab can be run on 
clusters using multiple processors at once, so that all 1000 simulations run 
faster. How many processors can I use for running this Matlab program on 
cluster A? Eventually, I’ll want to do the same for several different genetic 
starting points (variation files).
-Jane
--------------------------
~~~ 
(continued later...)

<a name="non-anticipate"></a>
<h2>Anticipate the Real and Next Questions</h2>

In some cases, the original question(s) may be limited by the
researcher’s current knowledge of ACI such that the researcher is
actually seeking an answer to a slightly different question; or such
that the researcher’s goals can be best addressed by a different
solution than originally suggested. Additionally, the Facilitator may be
able to anticipate and answer other questions in order to reduce the
amount of back-and-forth communication. Inviting a transition to an
in-person meeting – perhaps more similar to an engagement – may even be
a more appropriate solution for assisting the researcher.

Example 2: (continued)

~~~
------------------------
Hi Jane,
Thank you for the additional information. Based upon what you’re 
describing, I believe you can accomplish more by running many separate 
Matlab jobs that each use a single processor, instead of being 
limited by how many processors a single Matlab job can run on. Our 
cluster B is ideal for this type of high-throughput computing (HTC) work, 
and you will likely find that you could easily run more simulations with 
more parameters than on our Cluster A; you’ll also be able to repeat that 
many simulations for the different genetic starting points you describe.

As you might imagine next, this approach will mean that you will want to 
slightly rework your Matlab program a bit to read in a single parameter file, 
each time, in addition to reading in the genetic file. So you’ll also want 
to pre-create separate parameter files that each only have the relevant 
parameters for a single simulation. Let me know if you’d like pointers 
in Matlab’s documentation on how to read in the files or ideas for breaking 
up a parameter file.

Our own online guides for how to set up and submit many single-processor 
Matlab jobs is here: www.compute-center.school.edu/htc-matlab-jobs

Let me know if you have any questions about the above information.
 We can always meet to discuss more, if you like. ‘Sound good?

Michelle

<a name="non-empower"></a>
<h2>Empower the User to Find Her/His Own Answers</h2>

As demonstrated in the facilitator’s response above, it is important to
link to external resources that contain solutions for achieving a
researcher’s goals. This practice is not only important for providing
next steps, but also demonstrates how one might find answers to such
questions more quickly in the future, as was hinted in the prior
example. Another example of these practices is provided below:

Example 3:  Email from researcher regarding command-line text editors

~~~
Hello,
I have been using the nano text editor on the cluster servers, but I hear 
that other text editors have more options. Which text editor would you suggest?
-Zoe Chemist
------------------------
Hi Zoe,
My personal favorite for the command-line is the ‘vim’ text editor, which 
is on just about any Linux server. You can certainly find a number of online 
tutorials in various formats, by searching online for “vim text editor guide”. 
You can also find many online comparisons of text editors beyond ‘vim’ by 
searching for something like “which command line text editor is best?”. There 
are heated debates, and most people who use the command line have strong 
preferences, but the information you find will likely help you decide which 
text editor you might prefer. I prefer ‘vim’ (sometimes referred to as ‘vi’) 
because it is more powerful than ‘nano’, with a moderate number of standard 
options. I’d be happy to discuss more, if you like.

Cheers,
Michelle Facilitator
-------------------------
~~~

While it should always be the goal of a Facilitator to enable
researchers to do more for themselves, indicating how a researcher can
find her/his own answers should not be intended to discourage the
researcher from seeking assistance from Facilitators and other staff.
Facilitators need to find a balance between empowering researchers to
learn to find their own answers while still welcoming future assistance
requests, as needed.

Jump to: [top](#toc)

<a name="proactive"></a>
<h1>Proactive Support</h1>

Proactive user support can be thought of as assistance initiated by the
Facilitator rather than by a user of an ACI resource. It might be
helpful to the researcher when a Facilitator occasionally checks in, not
only when indications of difficulty become apparent (in user metrics,
for example), but also to understand how a researcher’s use and
satisfaction of ACI may have evolved. Often, but not always, proactive
assistance may even evolve into conversations more akin to engagements.

This particular activity is perhaps the most important component
distinguishing the facilitation approach from more common approaches of
supporting users of CI, whereby researchers are provided with written
documentation and are left to initiate contact with facilitators.
Proactive assistance allows Facilitators to build upon relationships
with researchers and, more importantly, to identify issues that users
may not think to ask about.

A few possible reasons to proactively contact a user are:

1. Metrics indicate misuse of an ACI resource. 
2. Metrics indicate that a user’s work may be better optimized. 
3. A sudden increase in the user’s activity potentially indicates a new type of work with different resource needs to address. 
4. The Facilitator believes a follow up to previous assistance may be helpful, perhaps after reviewing tickets.
5. The Facilitator may simply want to check in with a long-time user who hasn’t written in with any issues in some time.

If the reason for contacting the researcher is more akin to issue
resolution or proposing enhancements to the researcher’s use of ACI, the
Facilitator will likely follow assistance communication steps as
described in previous topics of “Addressing User-reported Issues” and
“Assistance for Non-issue Support Requests”. However, simple follow-ups
regarding the researcher’s assessment of ACI resources and services,
his/her evolving research goals, or simply to see how things are going
will likely follow more of a casual interview. If the Facilitator has
specific goals in contacting the researcher, preparing a set of specific
questions will be helpful. More information on understanding researcher
attitudes using interview-like interactions is available in 
*Assessment and Metrics*.

<h1>Reflection on Assistance Experiences</h1>

Over time, Facilitators will most likely identify common needs,
misunderstandings, issues, etc.. In such instances, Facilitators are
ideally poised to understand and represent the evolving needs of the
user community in order to inform future changes to support routes and
ACI systems that may include:

<ul>
<li>Changes in practices relevant to engagement and assistance</li>
<li>Improvements or additions to outreach and education/training approaches 
and content</li>
<li>Improvements to and selection of middleware and other mechanisms by which 
users interact with ACI (e.g., user interfaces, selection of compute scheduling 
middleware, etc.)</li>
<li>Configuration adjustments to ACI systems/technology that enhance user 
outcomes (e.g., enhancements to ACI system availability, optimizations to 
compute scheduling efficiency, etc.)</li>
<li>Enhancements to existing ACI resource capabilities and/or capacity</li>
<li>Policies and cost models governing user access to ACI resources and capacity</li>
<li>Addition of new ACI resources and capabilities</li>
</ul>

Importantly, Facilitators need built-in communication pathways and
working relationships by which feedback regarding the above areas can be
readily communicated to ACI resource providers and technology
specialists, as described further in the chapter on *[Interfacing with ACI
Resource Providers](../09-interface)*. To the extent that the above ACI changes might be
informed by measures and systematic evaluation, additional
considerations are covered in *Assessment and Metrics*.
