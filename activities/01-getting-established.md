# Introduction

This chapter is written primarily for newly hired Facilitators,
especially those without prior experience with ACI facilitation and/or
working as part of an ACI team. It is meant to assist new Facilitators
as they start with the task of defining their role. The first section on
institutional context views the role of facilitation and the hiring of a
Facilitator through an institutional lens. Subsequent sections are on
understanding and owning the facilitator role, and examining aspects of
the on-boarding process that are specific to ACI facilitation, including
organizational structure, computational resources, the ACI team, the
user base, and current state of facilitation.

# Institutional Context

Whether the Facilitator is a new hire or is transitioning into the role
from a related position, they will benefit from an understanding of the
considerations that were important to the ACI organization as they made
the decision to hire an ACI Facilitator. For example, was the value of
facilitation known and in demand by the institution, or will it have to
be proven? Does the organization have specific expectations, or must the
role of the Facilitator be progressively defined by the new hire? 
Reflecting on these questions, or asking them directly of the
organization, is a good place to start as a new Facilitator. Even at
institutions where the value of facilitation is unknown, or the role of
the Facilitator is not well-defined, it is essential that there is
support for the concept of facilitation at a number of levels – the
institution, the ACI team, the researcher community – and a commitment
to provide the new Facilitator with the time and resources necessary to
succeed. 

<a name="administration"></a>

## Administrative Expectations 

There may have been multiple
reasons that motivated the institution to establish a Facilitator
position or there may have been a specific driving force, perhaps a
change or planned change in ACI resource availability and/or usage. When
making the decision to hire a Facilitator, the leadership of the ACI
organization would have considered a number of things to ensure success
for all stakeholders. To guide the hiring process and help define the
position, they may have addressed the following questions:

* What gaps exist in the expertise of the existing team members? 
* What are most important tasks/responsibilities of the new position? 
* What is the required skill set necessary to perform these tasks? 
* What educational background and experience are important? 
* Is there specific domain expertise that will be important for this facilitator?

The answers to these questions would have helped prioritize expectations
for the new position and helped guide the hiring process, including how
to reach an appropriate candidate pool.

## ACI Team Expectations 

Having an ACI team endorse the notion of
facilitation is also important to the success of a new Facilitator. The
existence of a supportive working environment, backed by a team that is
open to exploring new ways to enable researchers and is willing to spend
time to assist a new Facilitator in learning about its resources, is a
tremendous asset to a new Facilitator. Therefore it is crucial that the
ACI team be involved in the hiring process.

<a name="users"></a>

## User Expectations 

Support from the user base is also critical. The ACI
organization can begin to understand the climate of facilitation at
their institution by asking the following questions:

* Are users aware of facilitators and the facilitation services offered by
the ACI organization? 
* Do ACI users see the value of facilitation in
their day-to-day use of the ACI infrastructure? 
* What expectations might
ACI users have in terms of the services provided by the ACI organization? 
* Is there a culture of self-reliance – even if only
necessary due to lack of this type of support – that might preclude the
user base from fully embracing the new Facilitator, or is there a
collaborative culture in which researchers work with the ACI team to
explore solutions to problems?

<a name="location"></a>

## Physical Location 

Many facets of facilitation rely on the Facilitator
acting as a liaison between the user base and the ACI team. If the
Facilitator’s base of operation is convenient to both groups, it makes
it easy for the researcher to seek out the Facilitator, and for the
Facilitator to interact with the rest of the ACI team. In cases where
the ACI team members are all together in one location and all of the of
the user base is in close proximity to this location, this may not an
issue. However, not all campuses have a physical environment that is
conducive to the necessary level of interaction. In some cases the ACI
resources and the members of the ACI team are not located on campus, and
in other cases the ACI organization might support users in multiple
locations. In both of these situations it is important to consider
strategies that can be used to alleviate any physical separation.

If researchers are not all at one site, it might be possible for the
Facilitator to have an office at each site and schedule when they will
be in each location. An alternative solution is to  have the Facilitator
go to the researcher as needed. If the distance between locations is
sufficiently far as to make regular travel to a site infeasible, then a
selection of long distance communication tools should be offered. When
the members of the ACI team are not all at the same location and
therefore do not see each other on a daily basis, having set times and
mechanisms for interactions as a group is important. While in many
situations email communication is sufficient, there are times that some
form of a web based communication tool makes sense. Face to face time,
which can be accomplished by a regularly scheduled staff meetings, is
also important.

# Understanding the Facilitator Role

Once a person has been hired to serve as a Facilitator, a joint effort
between the Facilitator and the hiring manager to start to define the
position is the next step. While some aspects of the position, such as
the overall goals and major activities, may have been defined in the
hiring process, many will still have to be set once the Facilitator has
started. These might include day-to-day practices for carrying out
activities, and modes of working with teammates and reporting to
supervisors. In order to contribute to this dialog, a new Facilitator
should first discover and understand a number of details about both the
institution and their ACI-providing organization, including whether the
ACI organization is already established, or in the process of
establishing a user base for a new resource. Facilitators coming into an
institution with existing resources and an established user base,
whether or not they have had a Facilitator in the past, will have
different priorities than those who were hired to help assist in
building up ACI resources and utilization. 

<a name="user-base"></a>

## User base 

It is crucial that a new Facilitator understand the 
existing and prospective user base. A
new Facilitator should identify the major ACI users, the departments and
fields of study that are represented, and identify any special needs.
This information may or may not be readily available in the ACI group’s
systems; if not, efforts to obtain this information should be a
priority. For instance, the ACI group may already be collecting user and
usage statistics, or be able to assist the Facilitator in the collection
of this type of data. In addition, a Facilitator can explore
publications or other reports of research completed using ACI resources
in order to obtain information on the existing user base. While studying
the existing user base, Facilitators should ponder their prospective
users as well. At this point, it is important to begin identifying
avenues and opportunities for reaching out to both current and
prospective users (see *[outreach](../02-outreach)* chapter). 

<a name="organization"></a>

## Organizational structure 

The Facilitator will also need to understand the management and reporting
structure within the ACI organization, as well as how this structure
affects day-to-day operation. The reporting structure is critical
because it will determine whom the Facilitator should contact when
working on issues relating to responsibilities, priorities, and projects
of others in the organization. Similarly, learning the roles and
expertise of the organization’s staff members is important because it
will determine whom to contact for help with research and technical
questions.

Additionally, the Facilitator should understand where the ACI
organization is located within the organizational structure of the
institution. For example, some ACI teams may be stand-alone entities,
located within an institutional-level IT department, or under the
direction of a CIO or VP of Research; others may be separate from
institutional-level IT or located within a Computer Sciences department.
Is this group the sole provider of research ACI services for the entire
university or are there multiple providers of similar services present
across campus? Knowledge on how, and possibly reasons why, the ACI
organization interacts, or does not interact, with other ACI and non-ACI
services at the institution will directly impact the Facilitator role by
defining the scope of the position and the potential for forming
productive cross-organizational relationships (see *[Interfacing with
other ACI Personnel](../09-interface)* for more detail). 

<a name="existing-resources"></a>

## Existing computational resources 

A new Facilitator should make extensive efforts to understand the ACI
resources for which they have been hired to support, while also
developing an awareness of other related resources available to
researchers, both on campus and elsewhere, whether or not the resources
are currently being utilized. This includes detailed knowledge about
what resources exist and the types of resources directly managed by the
ACI organization, as well as knowing how to use these resources in order
to be able to effectively provide assistance.  Specific knowledge
includes:

* Details about the compute hardware 
	* what compute resources are available
	* what file systems exist 
	* what is the networking infrastructure 
	* what operating system(s) are supported
* Details on the batch scheduler and batch policies that are being used 
* What services are provided 
* Existing policies and procedures for use of the resources 
* Tools being used for user provisioning and tracking usage

For more on this topic, see the chapter on *[Assisting Researchers in the
Use of ACI Resources](../05-assistance)*.

The ACI organization should provide the Facilitator with sufficient
accounts and access to enable facilitation. Depending on the position
and responsibilities, full or command-limited administrative access may
be required for troubleshooting ACI use problems. Minimally, a
Facilitator will need to view and read user files; they may also need to
move file directories from a user’s area to a test area of their own.
Facilitators are encouraged to speak with the system administrator of
the ACI team to discuss how these special administrative permissions can
be configured. Similarly, for general assistance, the Facilitators
should know whom to contact for assistance with tasks beyond their
expertise, and for tasks that require access beyond what they have. For
much more on this topic, see the chapter on *[Enhancing ACI Knowledge](../07-aci_knowledge)*.

<a name="current"></a>

## Current state of facilitation 

If the ACI organization is new it will be
the responsibility of the Facilitator to establish good practices for
facilitation. If the Facilitator was hired to replace an existing or
previous facilitator, the new Facilitator should start by learning about
current facilitation practices and to understand how these can be
continued and improved for the best research outcomes. When a new
Facilitator is hired to augment an existing facilitator, it is important
that they work together to find ways to coordinate, so as to complement
each other, based on differences in their background and expertise.

If there are established facilitation models, tools, materials, and/or
preconceived notions of the working model for user interactions in
place, they should be reviewed in order to understand the current state
of facilitation as well as its effectiveness. These may include items
such as:

Facilitation materials Documentation (both user facing and internal to
the ACI organization) Training materials Practices for interacting with
researchers Engagement practices Issue/ticket systems Office hours
Training events Tools for managing users Account creation Usage tracking
Engagement tracking Tools for assessment of facilitation efforts

All of these are discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters of this
*[Best Practices of Facilitation Guide](..)*.

<a name="team-members"></a>

## ACI Team members 

In addition to
learning about ACI resources, the new Facilitator should learn about the
other members of the ACI team, with a focus on their expertise, their
responsibilities, and the ways the team interacts with one another in
order to support researchers. Beyond ensuring a productive relationship
with coworkers, this knowledge will assist the Facilitator in
accomplishing specific tasks, such as finding answers to researcher
questions, troubleshooting problems, and, most importantly, coordinating
assistance contributions from other staff. See chapters on *[Assisting
Researchers in the Use of ACI Resources](../05-assistance)*, *[Implementing 
a Researcher’s ACI Plan](../04-aci_plan)*, and 
*[Interfacing with Other ACI Personnel](../09-interface)* for 
more information on
these Facilitation practices.

# Owning the Facilitator Role

In the introduction to this document and in the following chapters, we
describe a wide range of facilitation activities to serve as a starting
point in determining the specific responsibilities of a facilitator. It
is up to the Facilitator and their supervisor(s) to define and
prioritize the specific practices of a given position, in order to meet
the specific needs and context of their organization. The goal is to be
able to identify and prioritize a set of responsibilities, including day
to day tasks, that focus on facilitation.

The Facilitator should work first to establish a presence within the ACI
organization, and then to identify ways to inform the larger ACI
community of the existence and role of the new Facilitator. A first step
is to prepare materials to introduce the Facilitator and enable them to
start to engage with the user base. This might include doing the
following:

* requisitioning business cards 
* developing an online presence (on the ACI website/social media stream) 
* introducing yourself in a newsletter article 
* giving a presentation to administrators/staff 
* giving a seminar to users 
* sending an announcement to a mailing lists 
* posting an announcement on the institution’s website

Some of these activities may require preparing new materials or
modifying existing ones in collaboration with the ACI team or
communications staff. Once the presence of the new Facilitator has been
established, it is time to begin to engage with the user base.

# Moving Forward

In the remainder of this document we present information about what we
see as the major aspects of facilitation, as presented in the overview
chapter, and share lessons learned from our collective experiences from
both being facilitators and from numerous discussions on facilitation
best practices as part of the ACI-REF program which funded the creation
of this document. While each organization will have unique facilitation
needs, much of the information provided is on the fundamental tasks of
facilitation: outreach, engagement, assistance and education. Each of
these topics are covered in the subsequent chapters of this document.

As Facilitators, we hope that this chapter, as well as the remainder of
the *[Best Practices of Facilitation](../..)* document and the additional
information found on our website, *[www.aciref.org](https://aciref.org/)*, serves as a useful
starting place as you begin a career as a Facilitator.  The material was
designed to answer questions, explain topics and suggest options that
may not have been immediately obvious when you first considered the
facilitation process.
