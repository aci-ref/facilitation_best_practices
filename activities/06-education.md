# Introduction

As an essential component of supporting any cyberinfrastructure
resource, documentation and training materials add to the range of
formats by which researchers can learn to most effectively leverage ACI
resources. Such materials not only serve as an important complement to
engagement and assistance activities, but are often - and should be -
informed by these activities. Facilitators are generally poised to be
most familiar with user interfaces to ACI resources and with the range
of researcher experiences and feedback; therefore, facilitators should
be able to organize, produce, and deliver functional learning resources
for ACI users.

For the purposes of defining the activities of Facilitators in this
space, *education* will refer more to materials and efforts to promote
knowledge and understanding of ACI resources, while *training* will
describe guided opportunities for researchers to develop specific skills
needed when applying ACI resources to their work. Importantly, though,
these two terms are not mutually exclusive, and many learning
opportunities will include a combination of *education* and *training*.

<div class="captioned">
<img class="captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DNJtFwoXUAApeXw.jpg" alt="Grant Administrators">

</div>

Furthermore, there are certainly overlaps between this chapter and that
for *[Outreach](../02-outreach)*, as some information delivered in outreach efforts
might certainly be thought of as educational. However, we distinguish
*outreach* and *education*, for the purposes of defining best practices,
by their intent: whereas, *outreach* was previously described as efforts
to promote awareness of ACI services and resources (including the
Facilitator role), as well as their general usefulness to research,
*education* will refer to information on how ACI resources work and how
to use these resources to specific research needs. For example, a
presentation promoting the various services of a campus research
computing center, delivered to a mixed audience of mostly non-users (or
not-yet-users), can be thought of as *outreach*. However, a presentation
giving new or intended users of a compute cluster details of job
scheduling, partitions/allocations, and submission files will be
described as *education* within this chapter.

We thus provide the following examples of education and training efforts
for users of ACI resources, which can and should be significantly
contributed to by Facilitators:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>online documentation of ACI system configuration (e.g. cluster
partitions, etc.)</li>
<li>online FAQs for using ACI resources</li>
<li>step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific tasks on ACI
resources</li>
<li>one-to-many training for various skills in using an ACI resource</li>
<li>videos explaining aspects of using ACI resources</li>
</ul>
</div>
Many of these different types of learning materials and opportunities
are described later in this chapter, drawing on the "Overall
Considerations" just below. We additionally cover general considerations
for composing and delivering training materials, and for incorporating
external materials into an overall structure for supporting the learning
needs of users of an ACI resource.

It is important to state that many of the ideas behind the tips and
practices in this chapter are not original. There exists a plethora of
established research and best practices guidance for the production and
delivery of education and training materials, including and reaching
beyond materials specific to cyberinfrastructure. We reference several
resources with informative conclusions from such research. However, the
information presented in this chapter should be thought of as more of a
gateway into other ideas, as we cannot be exhaustive. Not all
Facilitators will spend significant time preparing and presenting
materials for researcher learning. Those who do will benefit from
consulting additional resources on education and cyberinfrastructure
training, and on technical writing. Furthermore, a plethora of examples
of education and training examples exist for similar ACI resource
providers, including national resources.

<a name="considerations"></a>

# Overall Considerations

Regardless of the format of learning materials or their delivery (verbal
versus online text), there are overall practices and strategies that
will enable Facilitators and other ACI staff to develop these materials
for maximum effectiveness and production efficiency. In the following
text, we list and describe many of these considerations, though many of
them are also later discussed in the topics of "Composition Strategies",
“Delivery and Teaching”, “[Written Formats](#format-written)”, and 
“[Verbal Formats](#format-verbal)”.

<a name="gaps"></a>

## Identify Gaps

In order to inform education and training efforts, Facilitators should
regularly reflect on interactions with researchers to identify the most
common and important gaps in user understanding and gaps in existing
learning materials. Informative interactions will not only include
engagements and assistance with issues (including assistance tickets of
other staff), but also researcher reflections in pro-active support and
information obtained through assessment of user satisfaction with
existing learning materials (see *Assessment and Metrics*). Some
learning gaps may require simple updates to existing materials, while
others require the creation of new materials. Another form of a gap in
learning materials might be the lack of multiple formats, in which case
the material might  be made preferable for more researchers by pursuing
an additional format. In some instances, especially for information that
is generally relevant in a wide range of contexts (beyond the context of
any one specific ACI resource), Facilitators can simply point
researchers to existing, external documentation (see "[Leverage Existing
Materials](#existing)", below). For additions of in-house materials, we later
describe the importance of defining learning modules to specifically
satisfy pre-defined learning outcomes to fill known gaps (see also
[^2]).

Often, a nearly unending number of topics could be newly documented or
taught, so it is important to also consider *which* topics have the
greatest need for new learning materials, based on how essential each
topic is to the overall use of the ACI resource *and* on how often
researchers tend to struggle with them. Knowledge gaps applicable to
individual researchers may be best addressed in one-on-one assistance
explanations, whereas information consistently misunderstood by multiple
researchers will typically justify the addition of a specific online
tutorial or FAQ entry.

<a name="formats"></a>

## Pursue Multiple Learning Formats
 
It is often the case that different people will prefer certain formats
over others, and that this preference may depend on the material being
taught. A combination of formats may be applied within the same learning
material (e.g., a general explanation followed by step-by-step
instructions, a step-by-step guide that includes an FAQ component,
etc.). Furthermore, materials for *training* researchers in skills and
practices may be best delivered for some researchers as guided, workable
examples rather than hypotheticals, and others may still prefer
one-to-one assistance for directly applying specific practices to their
specific use-case(s), rather than examples. (See [^8] for
more on guided instruction.) As a result, we suggest that Facilitators
develop and promote multiple learning formats, (see "Written Formats"
and “Verbal Formats”) and include avenues for obtaining one-to-one
assistance described previously in *[Assisting Researchers in the Use of
ACI Resources](../05-assistance)*. Similar to the reason for providing assistance via
multiple communication pathways to accommodate researcher schedules,
in-person learning materials should also be available for independent
learning by researchers who can’t attend a pre-scheduled event.

<a name="existing"></a>

## Leverage Existing Materials

Often, topics that researchers need to learn about will not require the
creation of new materials as existing materials may be sufficient. For
example, highly-generalizable skills that apply to similar ACI resources
are often covered well in a number of other resources, especially online
materials (e.g., guides for the unix shell, text editors, or common
command-line file transfer tools). For in-house materials, it is often
important to point to such external references when introducing a
specific skill within a greater step-by-step example. However, there are
certainly instances when some amount of generalizable information will
be most effective when actually embedded within Facilitator-created
materials, instead of simply pointing to external sources, and in order
to avoid drawing the user’s attention away from the overall workflow.
For example, specific illustrative ‘tar’ commands might be included in a
guide for transferring large files between specific remote systems,
rather than simply stating that files should be tar’d and pointing to a
different guide about the ‘tar’ program.

Some examples of external learning materials are:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>documentation for various open-source and proprietary third-party
software (e.g., programming languages, queueing software, etc.)</li>
<li>online materials from national ACI resources (e.g., XSEDE, OSG, etc.)</li>
<li>open curriculum for live teaching via organizations like <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software
Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data
Carpentry</a></li>
<li>institutionally-supported proprietary training services, like
Lynda.com</li>
<li>Wikipedia and other online information aggregators</li>
<li>books (where appropriate)</li>
<li>faculty-developed, university-sponsored, or professional society
courses</li>
</ul>
</div>
Beyond pointing to external learning resources via in-house materials
and one-to-one assistance, Facilitators can also encourage researchers
to participate in external learning opportunities, including the
examples listed below:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>workshops by other local organizations</li>
<li>semester-long courses at the local institution, perhaps relevant to
specific research domains</li>
<li>massively open online courses (MOOCs) on ACI-related topics</li>
<li>workshops hosted by the technology industry (e.g., proprietary
software companies, specialized hardware manufacturers, etc.), in
addition to their online documentation</li>
<li>materials, in-person courses, and webinars provided by national ACI
resources (e.g., XSEDE workshops, annual Open Science Grid User School,
etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
Based upon assistance and engagement interactions, Facilitators and ACI
resource providers can list suggested external learning opportunities on
their website and/or share such information to user email lists, as
deemed appropriate.

Most importantly, external resources can and *should* be leveraged as
examples by which Facilitators and other staff can construct clear and
effective learning materials. To the extent that partners at similar ACI
resource providers and/or institutions have already produced them, the
Facilitator can also pursue options for re-using and/or adapting
portions of these materials (with permission via communication or
licensing), rather than composing materials from scratch. In fact, there
are a number of efforts to produce shareable curriculum and/or arrange
workshops specifically geared towards researchers who leverage ACI
technology, such as the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
organizations. In many of these cases, Facilitators may become certified
trainers for such organizations or may otherwise arrange local workshops
to teach the curriculum.

<a name="ease"></a>

## Organize and Promote Learning Materials for Ease of Use

To make the full set of learning materials easy to use, various topics
and lessons should be arranged within an overall conceptual navigation
structure, most typically in an online format (e.g.,. wiki, knowledge
base, or linked set of simple web pages). This structure itself should
inform or align with common pathways for incremental learning, though it
can also be helpful to clearly delineate such pathways within
introductory guides or to point to recommended next topics at the end of
a lesson. For materials that are truly meant to be used in a linear
fashion, learners will especially benefit from links to the "next" and
“previous” topics. It should also be clear to learners how and when to
access in-person versus self-help materials for various topics of
interest.

When external materials are pointed to, content creators should make
obvious to the researcher that these materials are external.
Additionally, it is helpful to provide context for how the external 
materials fit into the specific context of relevant ACI systems and
capabilities. As an example, a link to an external guide for the Unix
Shell might come with context that the unix shell is available on the
head nodes of the relevant compute center cluster. Similarly, in-house
materials that are truly specific to particular ACI systems (per
operating system, relevant use cases, job scheduling software, etc.)
should be indicated as such within the overall organization of learning
materials.

<a name="feedback"></a>

## Obtain and Integrate Feedback

In order to assess the clarity and effectiveness of any learning
materials or in-person sessions, it is important to obtain feedback from
learners. As discussed more fully in *Assessment and Metrics*, such
information can and should be obtained in different manners depending on
the format of the learning opportunity. For in-person training, it is
important to incorporate real-time feedback between learning modules
(i.e., "lessons" or “topics”) via anonymous survey forms or free-form
comments, which can inform pace and needs for clarifying previous
concepts. Furthermore, pre-learning and post-learning surveys
incorporated into in-person training efforts can indicate the extent of
learning and the perceived importance of topics to inform future
sessions. Surveys are also helpful for determining details about
learners that inform the overall impact of education and training
efforts for various demographics. For self-help materials, Facilitators
and other ACI staff should encourage feedback from researchers regarding
these materials whenever possible, and should also incorporate insights
from assistance activities into content improvements and additions.
Beyond informal feedback, regular surveys of the user community might
include specific impressions of specific learning materials and the
overall education and training approach of the ACI organization.

<a name="infrastructure"></a>

## Infrastructure Needed for Material Development
 
When developing learning materials, there are a number of resources that
allow for new materials and updates to be incorporated into existing
materials. While the exact set of resources will differ based upon the
format of the material, available tools, and preferences, we describe a
few general considerations for development learning materials.

### User-accessible publishing location

Firstly, materials should be developed with the specific intent of
making these available to researchers in an easy to access location,
most typically on the web. Even for in-person training materials, it is
useful to publish these in a location that can be accessed by
researchers before and after the learning session. When using an online
repository (e.g., wiki, knowledge base, GitHub, etc.) that is separate
from the primary webspace for a specific ACI resource, clear links to
the repository should be used. Furthermore, the number of repositories
for learning materials should be as minimal as possible, allowing for
ease of  navigation.

### Composition environment

For ease of creating materials, the composition environment should be
easy to use and  include support for consistent formatting and
publishing. For online materials, this may mean the use of templates or
auto-formatting tools, which are typically built in to wikis or
knowledge base environments. Furthermore, the environment should allow
for easy editing of existing materials with automated updating to the
publishing location. However, we acknowledge that the format of some
materials, such as videos, dictate a development environment that is
less amenable to additions and improvements.

### Version and contribution history

Finally, content development will often benefit from the use of version
control, to track past updates to materials and their contributors. The
use of version history tools not only makes tracking contributions to
materials easier across multiple contributors, but also keeps a record
of the past states of any learning materials. For learners, "last
updated" dates provide an indication of whether a self-learning guide is
likely up-to-date, and contributor names will allow users to connect
materials with Facilitators or other staff. However, as compared to the
previous two development requirements, more compromises might need to be
made for version and contribution history, depending upon the exact
format of materials and external factors, including preferences among
staff.

# Content Development Strategies

In this section, we summarize key strategies for designing and composing
learning materials for the use of ACI resources, drawing heavily on tips
from the literature on technical writing, documentation, and curriculum
development. Because many of these ideas are repeated across the
literature, we do not always cite them, though we provide a long list of
these resources at the end of this chapter. Later, we discuss tips
specific to the exact format of various learning materials, while the
strategies below should extend well to nearly all format types.

<a name="goals"></a>

## Establish Goals of the Learning Material

Consistent across all of the literature is the idea that content in
learning and documentation materials should be developed with clear
learning goals.[^5] [^2] In order to develop the
right materials for the information to be communicated, content
developers should consider the following details in light of learning
goals and best practices in curriculum development and technical
documentation:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>Which major style of informative material will be best?: <i>concept
guide</i> (akin to our "education" definition), <i>tutorial</i> (“training”), or
<i>reference</i> (akin to software manuals and indexes)? See [^3] 
and other resources for more on these three styles.</li>
<li>Furthermore, what amount of information should be presented within a
unit of learning material, taking care to avoid concept overload?[^10]
 For example, some established tips for in-person and
self-help tutorials indicate a general goal of 30 minutes for a single
uninterrupted unit of learning material, especially for beginner tasks. [^17] [^15]</li>
<li>Content should be evaluated against the goals for content and learning
outcomes, both in the editing process and when designing assessments of
learning.[^2]</li>
</ul>
</div>
In addition to informing content development, the goals of any unit of
learning material should be stated to learners in writing at the
beginning of the unit, so that learners can determine the relevance for
their learning needs. Especially for in-person learning opportunities,
this information will help researchers to determine which sessions are
worth their time and effort. Furthermore, it is important to tie guided
training of specific tasks into the higher-level goals and best
practices of any in-person session (covered more below in
"[Format-Specific Considerations](#format)").

<a name="prereqs"></a>

## Clearly Communicate Prerequisites and Limitations

Content that builds upon prior information should clearly identify the
knowledge and experience learners should already possess for maximum
impact, beyond general considerations for determining the relevant
audience. Similarly, any pre-requisites for existing access to any ACI
systems or tools (including a user’s own laptop) should be indicated
near the top of on-demand materials or be communicated in advance of
in-person learning opportunities. Limitations  and specific contexts for
the tools and practices in the content should be clearly described, to
inform a researcher’s decision to pursue solutions described in other
content, as appropriate.

<a name="units"></a>

## Organize Content within Conceptual Units

Within a single document or learning opportunity, different concepts,
tasks, and examples should be clearly identified within learning
materials. For example, a full set of information for a multi-hour
training event should be divided into manageable subtopics or tasks,
perhaps even as separate documents to follow during the training;
variations of task examples within the same, short online guide should
be labeled with distinct headings and be accompanied with task-specific
descriptions. The organizational structure of these units should be
provided in an outline-type list at the beginning of the learning
material or presentation. In written formats, the structure of content
should also be visually represented as distinct units, for example, by
using unique formatting for headings, paragraph indentations, lists, and
boxed text.

<a name="clarity"></a>

## Clarity and Brevity
 
Beyond the use of proper grammar, punctuation, and active voice, there
are well-established tips for achieving clarity in paragraph and
sentence structure within written materials on technical topics, and
with implications for verbal delivery (many are well-summarized and
exemplified in [^16]) These tips are represented in the below
list:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>Avoid jargon, seeking instead to find general terminology that will
already be familiar to the audience.</li>
<li>When introducing new, necessary terms, define them clearly and
consider drawing visual attention with formatting.</li>
<li>Use words efficiently, paring language down to essential messages and
avoiding redundancy. Write in short paragraphs.</li>
<li>Place key information and actions in the first clause of a sentence
and in the first sentence of paragraphs, especially for tutorials, where
action by the learner is frequently requested.</li>
<li>Balance the focus on specific details with necessary context for
interpretation and generalization.</li>
<li>Select simpler terms over more complex synonyms (e.g "use" over
“utilization” and “individual” over “individualized”).</li>
<li>Identify potential ambiguity in wording, and use specific nouns over
pronouns.</li>
<li>Use strong verbs to achieve active voice (i.e. "arranged" over “made
arrangements for”).</li>
<li>Find a natural sound for active voice by reading passages out loud.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Clarity and brevity are also achieved via clear planning of overall
content structure and concept ordering, in addition to the above tips
for wording and in-text structure. Some forms of documentation for
systems and tools may require exhaustive descriptions of features in
order  to serve as a reference. However, topic overviews and
task-oriented guides, including those used for verbal formats, may be
conceptually overloaded if too many edge cases or supplementary notes
are included throughout. Rather, some of these might be better presented
in special sections toward the end of a learning unit, perhaps under an
"extra information" or “advanced” header.

<a name="visual"></a>

## Use Visual Aids

<div class="captioned">
<img class="captioned size300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/visual-aids-in-facilitation.jpg" alt="Visual aids">
Visual aids help communicate systems, concepts and processes effectively
</div>

Visual aids should be incorporated to represent ACI systems,
interrelated concepts, and decision processes, where applicable.[^6]
 Overall context in written and verbally-delivered materials is
complemented by concept maps and flowcharts. Furthermore, visual
representations can often replace long blocks of descriptive text and
provide meaningful context for text. Diagrams of components within ACI
systems can accompany descriptions of how these components interact in
ways that are relevant for various use cases. Visual aids should be
displayed during or near verbal descriptions, for maximum impact.

<a name="revise"></a>

## Assess and Revise, Continually

Content developers should repeatedly improve learning materials during
the editing process, following informative feedback, and periodically
revisit materials with assistance experiences in mind. For example,
materials delivered in-person might be tweaked before each learning
event, based upon lessons learned from a previous delivery. Regardless
of the format, and because development of verbally-delivered materials
also requires significant written composition, developers of learning
materials should commit to writing as a process. This includes the
cyclic progression from planning to writing and to revising, not just
for individual modules and documents, but also for the holistic set of
learning materials which may be maintained by more than one individual.
In addition to planning out the content of new learning modules or
lessons, developers should also plan time for the composition process,
including time for review and testing by others.

    </ul> 
</div>


## Written Materials

Building upon the general strategies for designing and composing
learning materials, we discuss considerations specific to the three
established goal-based types of technical writing: conceptual/topic
overview, task-oriented tutorials, and references.[^6] We also
include FAQ documents, as they frequently align with the learning needs
of ACI users. As written materials are almost exclusively consumed via
online interfaces, and readers of online information often skim rather
than read exhaustively, the material should be composed and tested for
clarity and completeness while avoiding unnecessary detail. The use of
content modules and visual structure within a single, written document
can be used to  provide cues for learners to identify and locate the
specific information they need.

### Concept Overviews

*Concept overviews* or *topical guides* align most closely with our
earlier definition of *education* materials. High-level descriptions are
essential for introducing ACI resources, processes for obtaining access,
and use cases, and provide learners with an essential foundation for
more specific learning. While concept overviews can also dive into
greater detail, the task-oriented needs of researchers using ACI are
often better suited to *tutorials* (below). In light of previous
composition practices, concept overviews are best written with a
conversational tone.

### Tutorials

As the most effective format for achieving guided instruction[^8], 
*tutorials* describing how to execute specific
tasks will likely make up the bulk of learning materials composed by
Facilitators and other ACI staff. Step-by-step use cases demonstrated in
tutorials can be hypothetical, serving as examples upon which a
researcher could construct a solution for their specific use case, or
can be fully workable exercises to be executed exactly by the researcher
before applying the overall process to their own case. For the latter
approach, all materials (files or file contents), stepwise commands, and
expected outcomes should be clearly described and presented, making up
for the lack of live coding by an in-person instructor.

### Reference-style Documentation
 
Reference materials documenting ACI features for various systems and
software tools serve as an essential partner to high-level conceptual
overviews and tutorials, including established examples for software
‘man’ pages and glossaries. While in-house references will likely only
serve as extensive resources for in-house tools, other non-reference
learning materials should point to existing external references for
users desiring more in-depth and detailed information about specific
features. For example, non-reference materials produced by ACI staff
should include links to reference materials for established third-party
software, though additional reference materials created in-house might
provide a shorter reference for the most important features for such
software (for example, the most common user commands for specific job
scheduling software).

### FAQs

A final and common form of written documentation for ACI resources is
the Frequently Asked Questions or FAQ document, with practices drawing
on a combination of those for other written formats. Because the FAQ is
such a specific and pervasive format of documentation, numerous sources
can be found on the web with common practices for generating effective
FAQs, and therefore will not be cited here. Generally, FAQs should:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>include questions that *are* frequently asked</li>
<li>be organized into groupings of similar concepts, in order to evoke
high-level conceptual frameworks</li>
<li>include the most essential and simple questions first, before listing
less common and more complex questions</li>
<li>directly answer the question, or at least point to additional
information</li>
<li>be updated frequently</li>
<li>solicit new questions and communicate clear pathways for seeking
answers and assistance</li>
</ul>
</div>
Overall, FAQs should be treated with the same development and editing
processes as for other forms of written learning materials, even though
they are often perceived to be a simpler form of documentation.

<a name="format-verbal"></a>

## Verbal Formats

While written materials are more likely to include effort from other ACI
staff, the verbal delivery of materials by Facilitators is important to
the Facilitator-researcher relationship. Because many of the Facilitator
activities documented here (Outreach, Engagement, Assistance, etc.)
depend on some form of informative communication, verbal delivery by the
same individuals will strengthen relationships with researchers and is
likely to encourage more questions during an in-person learning session.
Even with superbly-developed materials to guide verbal delivery, good
teaching often comes down to the aspects that are unscripted, including
two-way interactions between instructors and learners. Well established
practices for live teaching and verbal communication exist in a variety
of summative resources (including [^1] [^9] [^15]). Furthermore, Facilitators
can also leverage workshops and other training materials for developing
good teaching skills.

Ultimately, prevailing wisdom indicates that the development of good
teaching skills relies heavily on watching others teach and on repeated
teaching experiences, with significant benefit from the implementation a
few specific practices. For teaching skills relevant to ACI, teachers
should implement proven practices for well-paced live examples so that
learners can follow along.[^8] [^14] [^15] In class exercises and discussion
should include opportunities for peer-learning and pair programming,
perhaps by encouraging more advanced learners to assist others who may
be struggling.[^11] [^14]

Effective teachers leverage practices for gauging and motivating
learning, in real time, including frequent opportunities for questions
and feedback, in addition to reading visual cues for which students are
struggling. Teaching that empathizes with learner frustrations and
motivating factors is essential, even for Facilitators who naturally
identify with the typical struggles of researchers in learning ACI
topics and is based upon their own experiences. To avoid demotivation of
learners, instructors who have significant expertise over learners
should leave out personal perceptions of ease and complexity, in order
to avoid clashing with learner perceptions, and should avoid
condescending language like the word "just".[^1][^15]

While instructor’s should establish trust in their expertise and
recommendations, learners will ask more questions and seek help when
instructors are frank about their own knowledge limitations.[^15] Furthermore, 
instructors should
revisit learner motivations and expectations for a particular learning
opportunity by frequently tying specific concepts and tasks to desired
goals, outcomes, and best practices for using ACI in real-world use
cases.[^1]

Beyond the above practices for live instruction, we specifically discuss
considerations for various types of verbally-delivered learning
sessions, including information talks, training in one-to-many and
one-to-one formats, and one-way verbal teaching through recorded videos.

### Informational Talks
 
Typically, informational talks will follow the style of *education* and
*concept overviews* over tutorials for *training*, although a
combination of styles may be employed in the same learning event to
achieve holistic learning outcomes and provide variety. For example, an
information talk introducing a computing cluster and forms of compute
parallelization may precede intro tutorials for basic use of a cluster.
Otherwise, lone informational talks are very similar to *outreach*,
drawing on the same best practices for content development. However, the
inclusion of hypothetical examples for executing ACI tasks, within an
informational talk, can serve as a form of guided instruction and is
especially effective if the presentation materials or a recording are
made available.

### One-to-Many Training

As compared to informational talks, *training* in a classroom or similar
in-person format often takes the form of *tutorials*. These tutorials
may be introduced with short or long periods of informational talks in
some cases. (Software Carpentry workshops and curriculum, for example,
focus maining on hands-on guided practice with bits of explanation prose
along the way.) Importantly, one-to-many training materials can often
serve double-duty for in-person and self-help learning, if made publicly
available beyond their use at in-person learning events.

### One-on-One Training

Training in a one-to-one format with single or few researchers will
typically resemble Assistance meetings and office hours, where practices
of pair-programming and guided instruction (having researchers learn by
doing) are most effective. See more discussion in *[Assisting Researchers
in the Use of ACI Resources](../05-assistance)*.

### Videos

Because videos lack the typical two-way communication opportunities that
allow teachers to adapt in light of learner feedback and
misunderstandings, content development for videos (or even audio) faces
the same challenges for completeness and anticipation of difficulty as
for written guides. Therefore, the selection of materials to be
presented in videos should be well-informed by common questions and
difficulties observed from in-person assistance and teaching
experiences, and should depend on content completeness that has been
well-tested in other formats. While frequent updating and editing of
video-based learning materials is often more difficult without
completely re-recording the video, some technologies and video formats
can make this process a bit easier.

# Promoting Learning between Researchers

In addition to providing learning materials for researchers and
otherwise pointing researchers to materials that exist elsewhere, it is
also important to remember that researchers with similar ACI challenges
or in similar research areas might also learn a lot from each other. To
the extent that Facilitators record engagements and ACI plans and are
otherwise aware of researcher needs and solutions via assistance
practices, Facilitators can also connect researchers to each other.
Contexts for such connections might include instances where multiple
researchers:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>work in the same research group, and one is newer to the ACI resource</li>
<li>are pursuing similar research methods</li>
<li>rely on the same software</li>
<li>require the same specific features of an ACI resource (or its
configuration)</li>
</ul>
</div>
Learning from peers can be thought of as simply another form of external
learning resource, not produced or maintained by the Facilitator or
other ACI staff. Approaches for connecting researchers in order to
promote knowledge exchange,often referred to in the context of CI as
*technology exchange*, are more fully discussed in the chapter on
*Facilitating Connections*, including examples of facilitating
researcher communities around specific ACI topics and research methods.
Some ACI organizations and Facilitators even host repositories for
researcher-produced (but Facilitator-vetted) documentation for very
specific tasks and workflows on ACI systems to serve as examples other
researchers. (For more information on the significant benefits of peer
instruction and pair programming, see [^4], and [^11].)
