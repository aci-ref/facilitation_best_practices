# Introduction

To effectively support researchers who work on the cutting edge and push
the technological envelope, Facilitators too must keep up to date with
current and emerging technologies.  Facilitators should work to achieve
at least a basic knowledge of the latest hardware and software relevant
to ACI services, and to understand its utility and impact in the context
of the research community for which they provide a service. Just as a
Facilitator provides ACI training opportunities for researchers, they
too must attend workshops, participate in networking groups, and look
for other professional training opportunities to supplement their
existing knowledge of ACI. They should also seek out and review newly
developed learning materials, for both existing and emerging ACI
resources, for the purpose of identify potential on-site trainings for
their communities. Staying current can be a challenge, with numerous
updates and releases throughout the year, and especially if these
activities are not explicitly scheduled as part of a facilitator’s
duties, so devoting time to this pursuit, each week if possible, but at
a minimum each month, is highly recommended.

In addition to seeking information to enhance one's own knowledge of
ACI, facilitators should also look for existing resources and materials
that can be used by their research user community. Examples of these
kinds of materials are listed in the following sections, and may overlap
with the tutorials and documents listed as resources for facilitator
training

The rest of this chapter discusses resource types and specific
strategies for staying current with ACI resources as a Facilitator.

<a name="training"></a>

# Trainings and Professional Development 

In addition to studying online
resources and published materials on their own, it is recommended that
Facilitators participate in professional development opportunities that
combine learning and professional networking. Participation should focus
on areas that are of interest to the facilitator and will also benefit
the institution.  Ideas for areas to pursue professional development and
training for ACI facilitators are:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>Teaching: Facilitators should continue to update their skills in
teaching and learn the current trends and best practices to make
trainings more beneficial for researchers.</li>
	<li>Public speaking and presenting: In line with teaching methods, improving
presentation skills provides benefits not just in training but at
conferences and over venues where facilitators need to communicate.</li>
	<li>Grant writing: Many facilitators work in research institutions where
grant funding is common so learning or enhancing grant writing skills is
important.</li>
	<li>ACI Software: Enhancing skills with existing software tools at the
institution or learning how to use new tools is important in supporting
and serving the research community in their use of similar tools.</li>
	<li>ACI Hardware: Some facilitators work with ACI hardware for compute,
storage and visualization so it is important to keep those skills and
certifications current.</li>
	<li>ACI System Management: In keeping the ACI resources healthy and
functional there are a number of tools that are specific to making this
more manageable and efficient.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Many of the in-person professional development available to facilitators
are provided by vendors and through conferences and are discussed
further in this section.

<a name="vendors"></a>

## Vendors

Training opportunities are often also available through ACI hardware and
software vendors. Most of the hardware and some of the software utilized
in ACI is sold by commercial vendors whose sales teams are often
incentivized to help advertise their products by providing product
training for their customers. These trainings  typically occur at
workshops in conference settings and are  most useful when the vendor
has a worthwhile training module that enhances a facilitator’s
understanding of how to utilize the product to accelerate or advance
research and is relevant to the targeted community. If there is already
a relationship with a vendor, for a product that the institution has
acquired or that the research community is  using,  or if the
institution plans to make new or additional purchases, the Facilitator
can usually work with the vendor to produce a quality training
opportunity.

In addition to trainings, vendors can provide information about upcoming
products that may offer a glimpse of the direction the industry is
heading, for similar products and services. Having a good working
relationship with vendor representatives can keep Facilitators informed
about current  technology, in addition to providing existing product
updates and improvements.  This usually requires no more than a simple
subscription to a mailing list or company newsletter. Information can
also be directly solicited from vendors to enhance a facilitator’s
personal knowledge or relationship with a representative, for example, 
to request the vendor’s participation in training events, to enhance
potential offerings at an ACI site.

<a name="conferences"></a>

## Conferences

Academic conferences are an important venue for networking and knowledge
exchange among researchers and other domain experts. . They are often
the place where cutting edge ACI is presented and published in the
conference proceedings. There is great opportunity for learning at these
events, both interpersonally and professionally, and ideas can often be
brought back to the Facilitator’s institution and applied in their own
work and facilitation. In addition to meeting and learning from others,
conferences provide  many opportunities for sharing a Facilitator’s own
experiences and research, by submitting a poster or presentation
abstract, or by contributing to an organizational presence, for example,
if the Facilitator’s institution has  an exhibition booth.

Attending conference presentations is a good way to learn and improve
skills and knowledge in a new field or area of interest. It is a good
opportunity to engage with the work of others — to ask questions and to
talk with presenters, or participants after a panel. Like any other
profession, interpersonal networking is important for ACI facilitation.
This is also a potential avenue for making contacts that may lead, for
example, to being invited to join collective research projects and
grants.

Another opportunity for meeting other Facilitators and becoming known in
academic circles is to organize a panel session at one of the
conferences. Knowing the appropriate  individuals to ask for assistance
will make a Facilitator more effective. Facilitators are encouraged to
write to others in their field to propose a panel, birds-of-a-feather
(BOF) session, or meetup event.  These kinds of sessions  provide
opportunities for interpersonal engagement and organized discussions of
current topics with a wide-range of practitioners in the topic area.

Some examples of ACI conferences that have been beneficial for current
ACI facilitators are:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>XSEDE annual conference</li>
	<li>Advanced Research Computing Consortium (ARCC) meeting</li>
	<li>HTCondor Week</li>
	<li>Supercomputing (SC) conference</li>
	<li>Open Science Grid All-Hands meeting</li>
	<li>Internet2 conferences</li>
    </ul>
</div>
There are a variety of conference opportunities to choose from and all
have the potential to be beneficial if relevant organizations, content
and people are present.  Keep in mind the benefit of the conference as
well as the discussions amongst peers when considering what to attend.
Some of the more impactful professional development and training
opportunities available at conferences can also occur during the days
preceding the conference, as half or whole day tutorial and workshop
events,which often have a broader focus than the single topic short
sessions of the technical conference.

# Online Resources

The easiest way to stay current with new developments in ACI is through
the many existing online communities. Most announcements, updates, news
articles and other publications are first released on websites, in
regular emails, and within community forums. Beyond the reading
materials, there may be online video tutorials and self-paced trainings
published by various ACI experts that may guide facilitators to new and
popular areas of interest. Furthermore, these online resources can be a
starting point for finding collaborators in some of the emerging ACI
communities, and for learning about relevant face-to-face workshops and
conference opportunities.

The rest of this section provides the main categories of online
resources that should be considered and some examples of existing
resources that have been deemed helpful by others in the ACI community.

<a name="documentation"></a>

## Existing Documentation of Resource Providers

Many organizations and institutions have been creating and contributing
to a large body of ACI knowledge for decades. The resources are of
varying quality and states of maintenance, but using them can be more
efficient than creating in-house materials from scratch and can
highlight relevant focus areas. To aid in bootstrapping new
Facilitators, a compilation of broad ACI documentation and training can
be found in this chapter, in addition to a list that will continue to
grow on the http://aciref.org website.

<a name="networking"></a>

## Social Networks and Professional Organizations

Social media is a popular way to keep up with technological trends, as
news is readily posted by information providers. There are pros and cons
to its use: Its immediacy is beneficial in fast-paced arenas like
research and technology, however, the content is customarily not peer
reviewed, nor is there a guarantee of quality. With those caveats in
mind, facilitators can begin reaping the benefits of social networks by
joining various sites such as LinkedIn or Researchgate, which are aimed
at professional and research communications. Examples of LinkedIn groups
include:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>HPC - [https://www.linkedin.com/topic/high-performance-computing]()</li>
	<li>Cloud Computing - [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/61513/profile]()</li>
	<li>Women in HPC - [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8105215/profile]()</li>
	<li>Multicore and Parallel Computing -

	<li>CUDA Developers - [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1956294]()</li>
    </ul>
</div>
Before social media, professional organizations commonly provided an
outlet for networking with colleagues and learning of updates and the
latest trends. Most organizations have transitioned to social media and
may have a presence on numerous social media platforms, but still
maintain their own sites and offline presence as well. There can be
additional benefits to becoming a member of these sites, as well as
opportunities for participating in committees and governance groups.
Some examples of professional organizations that current ACI
facilitators find useful are listed below:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>ACM SIG HPC - [http://sighpceducation.acm.org/](http://sighpceducation.acm.org/)</li>

used to gauge the utility of further and future sites, as they arise or
are discovered.

<a name="reading"></a>

## Journals, Blogs and Trade Magazines

In academia, the scientific journal has been the classic repository for
knowledge and discovery.  However, blogs and trade magazines also offer
a gateway and enhancement to journal publications. These platforms
frequently offer ACI facilitators materials for learn about the current
trends of ACI as well as the current research taking place.

A list of suggested materials that is not exhaustive can be found in
this section and on the ACI-REF website.

# Using Connections With Other ACI Staff/Facilitators

Neither science nor facilitation take place in a vacuum. It takes an
academic village, where villagers know one another and work together, to
foster inquiry and research. These villages, or communities of practice,
consist of professional and subject matter networks. Similarly,
connecting with other ACI facilitators and researchers is an opportunity
for the exchange of ideas and knowledge about the many aspects of ACI.
These exchanges can enhance a Facilitator’s existing knowledge and
advance their professional growth.

However, networking requires an investment in time and many facilitators
already have little to spare. Ideally, they will choose networks that
provide the most benefit, and can do so by looking for networks that
meet the following criteria:

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>The network has a common and defined interest/goal</li>
	<li>The network is active via electronic communication (slack, email, forum
etc)</li>
	<li>The network follows a regular schedule for conference calls or virtual
interactions</li>
	<li>The network meets periodically at conferences for face-to-face
interactions</li>
	<li>The network is positive in communications about the subject of interest
but also able to be constructively critical</li>
</ul>
<div>
Some professional networks that meet the above criteria and are related
to ACI are:
<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
	<li>Campus champions - https://www.xsede.org/campus-champions</li>
	<li>Internet 2 - http://www.internet2.edu/communities-groups/members/</li>
	</li>ACI-REF - http://aciref.org</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Not to overlook the local resources at a facilitator's disposal,
networks can also be internal to an institution and the facilitator
should inquire about local groups or initiatives for faculty, staff and
graduate student researchers. These types of networks offer
institutional knowledge exchange, both historical and contemporary,
which can be useful technically, but are especially helpful for
understanding the institutional atmosphere.  In addition to these more
formal networking opportunities, there may also be less formal intra- or
inter-departmental events such as luncheon meetings with colleagues, and
faculty or visiting researcher presentations. The next chapter on
*[Facilitating Research Connections](../08-connections)* takes a more in depth look at making
connections and covers promoting opportunities for peer-learning between
researchers, aiding in the formation of collaborations and liaising and
matchmaking between users and ACI resource providers.
