This documentation represents the collective experience and understanding 
of ACI-REF participants; however, we recognize that our experiences are 
not comprehensive or authoritative. We welcome responses, suggestions and 
contributions to this material, to make it fully representative of the 
research support community it describes.  

Before contributing, we recommend that 
you read the [Introduction](http://aci-ref.github.io/facilitation_best_practices/introduction) in 
order to understand the purpose and method behind this documentation.  

<h2>To contribute or comment:</h2> 

This website is hosted through [GitHub](https://github.com/aci-ref/facilitation_best_practices). 
The main chapters are in the top-level folder named “activities”. The pages are generated from 
plain-text Markdown (.md) files for easy editing. See GitHub's tutorial on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for help with Markdown.

For those familiar with GitHub, we encourage you to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) 
the "[facilitation-best-practices](https://github.com/aci-ref/facilitation_best_practices)" repository to your own GitHub account (required) and start writing. To merge your changes, submit a "[New pull request](https://github.com/aci-ref/facilitation_best_practices/pulls)".

As an example, to edit the Chapter on Engagement in your GitHub account: 
* Select the folder named “activities” and then the page named “03-engagement.md”. 
* Select the pen icon ('Edit this file') to convert the web page to an editable text file. 
* Edit and preview your changes. When you are happy with the results, select “Commit changes” (bottom of page) to commit the changes directly to your default “gh-pages” branch. 
* Select “New pull request” and review the differences. When you are ready to merge your changes, select “Create pull request”, add a comment about the changes you made, and submit a final “Create pull request”. 

Alternatively, you can open a "[New issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)" and send your suggestion that way.  (Select the “issues” tab, leave a comment, and submit “Submit new issue”.)  A GitHub account is required to submit an issue.

For those less familiar with GitHub, or who are hesitant to contribute to a public document, please send your suggestions to ACIREF-OUTREACH@lists.clemson.edu.
