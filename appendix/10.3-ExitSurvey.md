An Annual or Exit Survey is designed to be given 1) once a year, either to all or selected resource users, or 2) to users who are closing their accounts. This survey has the following purposes: 

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
<li>Measure impact of ACI-REF assistance using metrics of experience, time saved, publications and other research outcomes</li>
<li>Gather feedback from users on how to improve</li>
</ul>
</div>

This document contains a suggested introduction and a variety of possible questions.  Not all questions included here would be necessary; facilitators should choose questions that are relevant to the information they want to gather. 

<h2>Suggested Introduction</h2>

Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey. Your responses here on the use of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) resources (e.g. cluster or cloud computing, high speed/software-defined networks, large storage arrays) will be used to gauge the impact of the ACI-REF program, both locally and nationally. We appreciate your honesty and answering to the best of your ability. Again, we appreciate your time and thank you for your cooperation.

<h2>Suggested Questions</h2>
