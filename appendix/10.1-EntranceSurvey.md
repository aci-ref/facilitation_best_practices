An Entrance Survey is designed to be given at account creation or introductory training (if required for resource use) to all users of the ACI resource.  This survey has two purposes: 

<div class="bullet-box">
    <ul class="bullet-list-square">
   <li>Allow both the ACI-REF program and the institution to gather demographics of the user base</li>
   <li>Understand user needs and experience</li>
</ul>
</div>

This document contains a suggested introduction and a variety of possible questions for an entrance survey.  Not all questions included here would be necessary; facilitators should choose questions that are relevant to their resources.  A sample implementation is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wisc.edu/forms/d/13k9AXGwl2Ih737bqzi_w4dj8IRYMs1CMAL0ZizbyPxI/edit">https://docs.google.com/a/wisc.edu/forms/d/13k9AXGwl2Ih737bqzi_w4dj8IRYMs1CMAL0ZizbyPxI/edit</a>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

Thanks for taking this moment to tell us a little about yourself and your background. We ask that you complete this survey as completely as possible. We ask that you be rigorously honest, to enable a clearer evaluation of your current  requirements and knowledge base,  thus allowing for  more targeted response to your needs.

Again, thank you for your input.
