<h2>Goals, Motivation, and Approach for Establishing Facilitation Best Practices</h2>

With a focus on truly accelerating scientific discovery, the NSF-funded
<a href="http://aci-ref.org">ACI-REF (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure - Research and Education
Facilitators) project</a> is changing the way that campuses approach
cyberinfrastructure solutions and support for scholarship. ACI-REF
facilitators (“ACI-REFs”) possessing significant interpersonal skills
and cyberinfrastructure-dependent research experience provide proactive
and personalized consulting to help researchers identify the greatest
potential impacts to their projects. Rather than possessing significant
depth of expertise in computation themselves, ACI-REFs leverage a
network of IT staff and their expertise to translate technical
information regarding a range of cyberinfrastructure solutions for
researchers via various engagement, teaching, and relationship-building
activities. Through a ‘teach-to-fish’ approach, dedicated ACI-REFs have
<a href="https://aciref.rc.fas.harvard.edu/category/impact/">enabled significant 
and previously unimagined scholarship outcomes</a>
across a variety of research domains.

As a project, ACI-REF hopes to bring the successful practices of
“facilitation” to other academic institutions and interested entities,
and across many types of cyberinfrastructure, by documenting the best
practices of ACI facilitation in this online website. For simplicity,
and because we hope that these best practices will generalize beyond the
institutions within the ACI-REF project, we refer to “Facilitators”
rather than “ACI-REFs” throughout the remaining *Facilitation Best
Practices* content.

In particular, we hope that the documentation herein will achieve the
following to enhance the impact of ACI services for scholarship: 

<ul>
<li>demonstrate the mechanisms by which effective facilitation leads to 
positive impacts on scholarship</li>
<li>assist supervisors in integrating, hiring for, and evaluating the Facilitator role</li>
<li>inform the professional development of Facilitators</li>
<li>refine the activities of other staff whose roles require aspects of facilitation</li>
</ul>

In the following portions of the *Introduction*, we define facilitation
and Facilitators to establish goals of impact for Facilitators as
compared to other traditional ACI staffing roles. Based upon this
philosophical description, we establish the major categories of
facilitation practices, referred to as Major Activities of Facilitation,
and discuss implications for the necessary skills and background of
effective Facilitators. Thus, the majority of the *Facilitation Best
Practices* documentation is presented as chapters (1-10) describing
specific considerations and approaches for each activity. The entire set
of documentation is also accompanied by *Definitions* of key terms and an
*Appendix* with supplementary materials that are referred to within the
chapters.

Importantly, the best practices established in this documentation are
meant to be continually revised, leveraging perspectives not only from
the ACI-REF project but also from an increasing number of institutions
which implement facilitation practices. We also acknowledge that many
institutions may implement Facilitator roles within a variety of
contexts. For example, some Facilitators may assist a variety of
researchers with the use of a specific ACI resource, such as an
institutional, large-scale (“HPC”) computing center, centralized network
infrastructure, or data management service. Other Facilitators may be
more closely associated with a specific subset of researchers needing an
ACI resource, perhaps for a specific department, college, or research
domain, and will more generally consult on the use of a variety of ACI
resource types. Across such a palette of facilitators and
specialization, we acknowledge that some of the various *Major Activities*
described herein will contribute in varying degrees to any single
Facilitator’s specific goals and practices.

<h2>What is Facilitation?</h2>


<a name="whatis-philosophy"></a>
<h3>Philosophically</h3>

<h4>Facilitation is ...</h4>

While many Facilitators spend their time on a variety of tasks that are
essential to providing ACI resources to research communities, the
activities of Facilitation are best represented in the below items.
Versus other ACI-related roles, a key component of Facilitation is to
assist researchers in leveraging ACI resources for themselves, rather
than performing research tasks on ACI systems for or as a contributor to
a specific research project.

<ul>
<li>Promoting awareness of ACI resources and their usefulness</li>
<li>Matchmaking of researchers and their needs with ACI resources and 
solutions appropriate for their specific needs, including resources on-campus 
and beyond</li>
<li>Consulting with researchers on the integration of ACI resources for 
the greatest impact to their scholarship, including the personalized 
selection of approaches, processes, and tools</li>
<li>Help researchers to identify</li>
<li>Training and assisting researchers to help them optimally leverage ACI 
capabilities into the future</li>
<li>Representing the user perspective to ACI service providers to 
inform short-term responsive changes and improvements to ACI resources</li>
<li>Understanding the evolving ACI needs of the research community, in order 
to anticipate and advocate for necessary technology advancements in the long-term.</li>
<li>Identifying and matchmaking potential collaborations between 
researchers based upon common research goals and/or uses of cyberinfrastructure.</li>
<li>Researching and understanding new ACI resources and capabilities</li>
<li>Partnering with staff at other institutions/organizations to promote the 
sharing of expertise.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h4>Facilitation is NOT...</h4>

Though the above activities are within the defined scope of Facilitation
throughout the handbook, many Facilitators may spend time on additional
activities that are *not* within the defined scope of Facilitation and
that are not described within the handbook. Examples of such activities
include, but are certainly not limited to:

<ul>
<li>building/configuring cyberinfrastructure systems, managing software 
or middleware installations across systems, etc. (perhaps better defined 
in the roles of Systems Administrator, Network Engineer, etc.)</li>
<li>development of software for specific groups (better defined as Researcher, 
Computational Scientist, Programmer, etc.)</li>
<li>performing computational research work for specific groups, including 
running computation work on ACI resources for research groups, outside of 
testing/validating recommendations (better defined as Researcher,
 Computational Scientist, etc.)</li>
<li>managing the roles of other staff at ACI resource-providing organizations</li>
<li>managing special projects within ACI resource-providing organizations</li>
</ul>

<h3>In Practice</h3>

*(Further Elaborated in “Major Activities”)*

<h4>Getting Established</h4>
<i>Defining one’s role, including expectations of institutional support 
required for effective facilitation. Training and education of new 
facilitators. Establishing initial connections with other staff.</i>

<h4>Outreach</h4>
<i>Promoting awareness and understanding of the facilitator role and of ACI
