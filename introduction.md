<h2>Goals, Motivation, and Approach for Establishing Facilitation Best Practices</h2>

With a focus on truly accelerating scientific discovery, the
<a href="http://aci-ref.org">ACI-REF (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure - Research and Education
Facilitators) project</a> is changing the way that campuses approach cyberinfrastructure 
solutions and support for scholarship. ACI-REF facilitators (“ACI-REFs”) possessing 
significant interpersonal skills and cyberinfrastructure-dependent research experience 
provide proactive and personalized consulting to help researchers identify the greatest 
potential impacts to their projects. Rather than requiring significant depth of expertise 
in computing or IT, themselves, ACI-REFs leverage a network of IT staff and their expertise 
to translate technical and procedural information into ACI solutions for researchers via 
various engagement, teaching, and relationship-building activities. Through a 
‘teach-to-fish’ approach, dedicated ACI-REFs have enabled
<a href="https://aciref.rc.fas.harvard.edu/category/impact/">significant 
and previously unimagined scholarship outcomes</a> across a variety of research domains.

As a project, ACI-REF hopes to bring the successful practices of “facilitation” 
to other academic institutions and interested entities, and across many types 
of cyberinfrastructure, by documenting the best practices of ACI facilitation, 
herein. For simplicity, and because we hope that these best practices will 
generalize beyond the institutions within the ACI-REF project, we refer to 
“Facilitators” rather than “ACI-REFs” throughout the remaining *Facilitation 
Best Practices* content.

In particular, we hope that the documentation herein will achieve the
following goals and enhance the impact of ACI services for scholarship: 

<ul>
<li>describe the mechanisms by which effective facilitation leads to 
positive impacts on scholarship</li>
<li>inform the professional development of Facilitators</li>
<li>assist supervisors in integrating, hiring for, and evaluating the Facilitator role</li>
<li>refine the activities of other staff whose roles require aspects of facilitation</li>
</ul>

In the following portions of the *Introduction*, we define facilitation
and establish goals of impact for Facilitators as
compared to other traditional ACI staffing roles. Based upon this
philosophical description, we establish the major categories of
facilitation practices, referred to as *[Major Activities of Facilitation](../activities)*,
and discuss implications for the necessary skills and background of
effective Facilitators. Thus, the majority of the *Facilitation Best
Practices* documentation is presented as chapters (1-10) describing
specific considerations and approaches for each activity. The entire set
of documentation is also accompanied by *[Key Terms and Definitions](../definitions)* of key terms and an
*[Appendix](../appendix)* with supplementary materials that are referred to within the
chapters.

Importantly, the best practices established in this documentation are
meant to be continually revised, leveraging perspectives not only from 
the institutions contributing to the ACI-REF project but also from the 
increasing number of institutions implementing facilitation practices. 
We also acknowledge that many
institutions may implement Facilitator roles within a variety of
contexts. For example, some Facilitators may assist a variety of
researchers with the use of a specific ACI resource, such as an
institutional, large-scale (“HPC”) computing center, centralized network
infrastructure, or data management service. Other Facilitators may be
more closely associated with a specific subset of researchers, perhaps 
for a specific department, college, or research
domain, and will more generally consult on the use of a variety of ACI
resource types for methods *specific* to the research domain. Across 
such a palette of facilitators and
specialization, we acknowledge that the 
*[Major Activities of Facilitation](../activities)*
described herein will contribute in varying degrees to any single
Facilitator’s specific goals and practices.

There are a number of other specific interpretations of the “facilitator” 
term with accompanying documentation of best practices. Some of these 
refer more generally to the facilitation of group efforts in professional 
environments and other contexts. The documentation, has significant 
overlaps with other literature on "facilitators", and Facilitators of ACI 
resources for research might also benefit from considering these 
additional resources.

<h2>What is Facilitation?</h2>


<a name="whatis-philosophy"></a>
<h3>Philosophically</h3>

<h4><i>Facilitation is ...</i></h4>

Versus other ACI-related roles, a key component of Facilitation is to
assist researchers in leveraging ACI resources for themselves, rather
than performing research tasks on ACI systems for or as a contributor to
a specific research project. Thus, while many Facilitators spend their 
time on a variety of tasks that are
essential to providing ACI resources for research, the
activities of Facilitation are best represented in the below goals.

<ul>
<li>Promoting awareness of ACI resources and their usefulness</li>
<li>Matchmaking of researchers and their needs with ACI resources and 
solutions appropriate for their specific needs, including resources on-campus 
and beyond</li>
<li>Consulting with researchers on the integration of ACI resources for 
the greatest impact to their scholarship, including the personalized 
selection of approaches, processes, and tools</li>
<li>Helping researchers to select from various analytical methods and 
third-party tools, considering validity, ease-of-use, and scalability</li>
<li>Training and assisting researchers to help them optimally leverage ACI 
capabilities into the future</li>
<li>Representing the user perspective to ACI service providers to 
inform short-term responsive changes and improvements to ACI resources</li>
<li>Understanding the evolving ACI needs of the research community, in order 
to anticipate and advocate for necessary technology and human resources in the long-term</li>
<li>Identifying and matchmaking potential collaborations between 
researchers based upon common research goals and/or uses of cyberinfrastructure</li>
<li>Researching and understanding new ACI resources and capabilities</li>
<li>Partnering with staff at other institutions and organizations to promote the 
sharing of expertise</li>
</ul>

All of these goals are enabled by the *Major Activities of Facilitation*, defined 
further below under *[In Practice](#whatis-practice)*.

<h4><i>Facilitation is NOT...</i></h4>

Though the above activities are within the defined scope of Facilitation
throughout this documentation, many Facilitators may spend time on additional
activities that are *not* within the defined scope of Facilitation and
that are not described. Examples of such activities
include, but are certainly not limited to:

<ul>
<li>building/configuring cyberinfrastructure systems, managing software 
or middleware installations across systems, etc. (perhaps better defined 
in the roles of Systems Administrator, Network Engineer, etc.)</li>
<li>development of software for specific groups (better defined as Researcher, 
Computational Scientist, Programmer, etc.)</li>
<li>performing computational research work for specific groups, including 
running computation work on ACI resources for research groups, outside of 
testing/validating recommendations (better defined as Researcher,
 Computational Scientist, etc.)</li>
<li>managing the roles of other staff at ACI resource-providing organizations</li>
<li>managing special projects within ACI resource-providing organizations</li>
</ul>
